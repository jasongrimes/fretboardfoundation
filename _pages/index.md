## A novel approach to learning guitar

Fretboard Foundation is the fastest way to learn the most fulfilling kinds of guitar playing: improvisation, soloing, jamming with others, chord melody, and playing by ear. 

It’s also the most thorough way to master Western harmony on the fretboard.

## Why this method?

I created the Fretboard Foundation method because after decades of study, I had grown deeply unsatisfied with the traditional method of guitar teaching. 

And though I searched for most of my life, I could never find a straightforward explanation of the core knowledge that was obviously possessed by those I considered masters of the art. They would share bits and pieces of wisdom,
but it was always incomplete and left a tremendous amount unsaid.  It had yet to be analyzed and distilled into an accessible method. 

So eventually I assembled it myself.

## What’s different about Fretboard Foundation?

### Get good enough to jam, right away

For starters, Fretboard Foundation gets you jamming along with music you enjoy within the _first minutes_ of your very first lesson.

The object of this method is to learn to _create music_;
to express yourself creatively on the guitar.
To play by ear, and improvise guitar solos, and even to play chord melody, starting at the very beginning of your studies.

It's possible for absolutely anyone to do this in a very simple form right away.
And then to gradually learn more and more over time, in order to have even more fun and make even better music.
Directed by your own joy and motivation,
rather than by a boring "no pain, no gain" teaching method that promises fun someday in the future.

### Learn the most useful things first

Fretboard Foundation introduces guitar skills in a different and more useful order than they are taught in traditional methods.
It's based on the idea of _triage_: doing the most important things first to make the best of limited time and resources.

In the long run, it would be ideal to learn everything. But life is rarely ideal, and the length of our run is unknown.

We should not assume that you have years to dedicate to an assembly line method, with dull but carefully planned practice routines every day, step after boring step, until months or years later you are ready to play music you actually like.

Instead, Fretboard Foundation gets you playing music you like _today_, and then a little bit better music tomorrow, and a little better every day after.
Until life inevitably gets in the way, and you need to take a break for a while.
Then later on you can pick up more or less where you left off, and continue on your journey.

### Master Western harmony from the fundamentals

After you have begun to develop your ear and your taste by creating real music that you enjoy,
the Fretboard Foundation method begins to introduce fundamental concepts of Western harmony and more advanced guitar skills.

They are incorporated in the simplest and most practical forms at first,
in such a way that you can actually use them to create even better music,
and gradually expanded upon as you achieve more and more fluency.

## What’s wrong with traditional guitar teaching?

### It's outdated

The traditional approach to music education hasn’t changed much since the Classical period over 200 years ago. The rise of the formal concert hall in the 19th century, and the dawn of the Industrial Age, turned playing music into a profession, and music teaching into a kind of vocational training. 

### It was meant to produce human machines

The object of traditional music education was to produce finely tuned human machines who could perform note-for-note renditions of scores written by a handful of composers who somehow had access to the mysterious creative process. 

Because there was no audio recording technology at the time, musicians were trained to be essentially human record players. 

### It was never meant to be fun

While it’s truly amazing to see and hear the achievements of highly skilled classical musicians, the training that produced them was exhausting and even brutal. 

It was work, not play. It was never meant to be fun.

### We don't need human record players anymore

Times have changed. 

Today, if we want to hear some music, it only takes a couple clicks on Spotify or YouTube to play almost any song at any moment. We don’t depend on talented musicians to reproduce it for us in person. Musicians no longer need to be human record players. 

The object of music education can be different now.

### Creative artists are  ill-suited by the traditional method

Today, the best reason to play music is to express ourselves creatively. To move others, and ourselves, and produce profound shared experiences. To create art, and to have fun.

But traditional music education is not very helpful for this. In the early stages especially, it is just not very fun. And in the end, after all that effort, it often doesn’t get us much closer to creativity or self-expression, either. 

Many potentially talented artists are turned off by the dry and boring educational process, and give up before they are able to express themselves on the instrument. 

And many musicians who have been trained the traditional way are very good at sight reading scores and performing someone else’s music, but find themselves unable to jam, improvise creatively, or play even simple melodies by ear.

Fretboard Foundation was created to provide a better way.
