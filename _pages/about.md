This site is a tool for creating and sharing a book Iâ€™m slowly writing called
[_Fretboard Foundation: Practical building blocks for intermediate guitarists_](book.html).

See the [preface](preface.html) for more about the book, 
and the [author page](author.html) for more about me.

The book is freely available on this website, 
and will remain so after it is completed. 

## Contact and corrections

Please send any corrections or other correspondence through the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jasongrimes/fretboardfoundation/issues) for this project,
which does require a free GitHub account but which makes changes much easier to manage.

Correspondence can also be sent to
[contact@fretboardfoundation.com](mailto:contact@fretboardfoundation.com),
but please note this address is rarely monitored.

## Technology

This website is rendered into static HTML with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It uses a custom Jekyll theme called [jekyll-chapterbook](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook)
that I created to support a proper book format and my preferred workflow.
