This site is a tool for creating and sharing a book Iâ€™m slowly writing called
[_Fretboard Foundation: Practical building blocks for intermediate guitarists_](book.html).

See the [preface](preface.html) for more about the book, 
and the [author page](author.html) for more about me.

The book is freely available on this website, 
and will remain so after it is completed. 

## Contact and corrections

Did you find a mistake? Do you like the book (or hate it)? I'd love to hear from you.
Please send an email to 
[hello@fretboardfoundation.com](mailto:hello@fretboardfoundation.com),
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

## Technology

This website is rendered into static HTML with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It uses a custom Jekyll theme called [jekyll-chapterbook](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook)
that I created to support a proper book format and my preferred workflow.
