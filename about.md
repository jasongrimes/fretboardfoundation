This site is a tool for creating and sharing a book I’m slowly writing called
[_Fretboard Foundation: Practical building blocks for intermediate guitarists_](/).

See the [preface](preface) for more about the book, 
and the [author page](author) for more about me.

The book is freely available on this website, 
and will remain so after it is completed. 

See a list of topics available in the [table of contents](toc). 


## Technology

This website is rendered into static HTML with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
using a custom Jekyll theme called [jekyll-chapterbook](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook)
that I created to support a proper book format and my preferred workflow.

## Contact

Please note:
I cannot promise to get back to you in any reasonable amount of time, if ever. 
I sincerely don’t mean to be rude, 
but that’s just the reality. 
It’s best if we’re all prepared for it. 

I *do* promise to give my attention eventually to any thoughtful correspondence I receive,
and maybe even reply. 

Please set your expectations accordingly. 

Correspondence about the book or this site should be directed to
[contact@fretboardfoundation.com](mailto:contact@fretboardfoundation.com).
