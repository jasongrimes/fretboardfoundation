This site is a tool for creating and sharing a book I’m slowly writing called
[_Fretboard Foundation: Practical building blocks for intermediate guitarists_](/).

See the [preface](preface) for more about the book, 
and the [author page](author) for more about me.

The book is freely available on this website, 
and will remain so after it is complete. 

Though still in its early stages, 
I hope that it already contains information that is helpful to the intended audience. 
I aim for the book to be able to stand on its own as a useful resource during the entire writing process, 
even without the support of yet-unfinished pages. 

For a list of what’s available so far, 
see the [table of contents](toc). 
The [outline](outline) has details about what’s to come. 

## Technology

This website is rendered into static HTML with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The Jekyll theme used is a fork of Tao He’s clever and immensely helpful [jekyll-gitbook](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook) theme, 
which in turn is based on an early theme of [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/).

I hacked poor jekyll-gitbook to bits in order to support my own personal tastes and workflow. 
Eventually I would like to release these changes as a public theme that others can use with GitHub Pages. 

## Contact

**Please note:**
I cannot promise to get back to you in any reasonable amount of time, if ever. 
I sincerely don’t mean to be rude, 
but that’s just the reality. 
It’s best if we’re all prepared for it. 

I *do* promise to give my attention eventually to any thoughtful correspondence I receive,
and maybe even reply. 

Please set your expectations accordingly. 

Correspondence about the book or this site should be directed to
[contact@fretboardfoundation.com](mailto:contact@fretboardfoundation.com).
