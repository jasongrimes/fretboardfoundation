title: Other diatonic modes
slug: diatonic-modes
abstract: The diatonic modes are the seven modes of the major scale, including the major ("Ionian") and natural minor ("Aeolian") already covered. Each of the other five modes differs from Ionian or Aeolian by a single tone, which is the source of the mode's unique sound and feel.

## What are diatonic modes

The diatonic modes are the seven permutations of the major scale,
with each permutation starting at a different degree of the major scale 
and wrapping around to the beginning as needed.

Starting with the first degree of the major scale,
the diatonic modes are
(1) Ionian,
(2) Dorian,
(3) Phrygian,
(4) Lydian,
(5) Mixolydian,
(6) Aeolian (the natural minor scale), and 
(7) Locrian.

One mnemonic to help remember the modes is "I Don't Punch Like Mohammed A-Li".
