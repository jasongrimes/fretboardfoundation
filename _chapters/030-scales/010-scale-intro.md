## Scale definitions

A scale is an ordered collection of notes and the intervals between them.

The notes in a scale are numbered in order,
from lowest pitch to highest. 
These numbered notes are called “scale degrees”. 
Scale degree numbers are often written with “hats”, 
like this: 1&#x302;, 2&#x302;, 3&#x302;, etc. 
The first degree of a scale (1&#x302;) is often called the “tonic”. 

The intervals between scale degrees are often described in terms of “half steps” and “whole steps”. 
A “half step” is the smallest interval on the fretboard, 
the distance between the notes on either side of one fret on the same string
(a “semitone” or “minor second” interval). 
A “whole step” is two half steps, 
a distance of two frets (a “tone” or “major second” interval).

Most scales can be described by a formula that specifies the half steps and whole steps between scale degrees. 
For example, the major scale formula can be written like this: 
WWHWWWH (a whole step from 1&#x302; to 2&#x302;, 
a whole step to 3&#x302;, 
a half step to 4&#x302;,
a whole step to 5&#x302;, etc.).

Scales can also be described by the interval between each scale degree and the tonic. 
For example, 
the major scale is said to have a major third and a major seventh, 
because the interval from 1&#x302; to 3&#x302; is a major third, 
and the interval from 1&#x302; to 7&#x302; is a major seventh. 
(This is so regardless of the fact that minor-third and minor-seventh intervals can also be found between other degrees of the major scale.)

## What scales are good for---and bad for

Scales are the foundation of melody and harmony.

Every key and mode is derived from a scale, 
sometimes called its “parent scale”.
The notes in the key are the notes of the scale, 
and the chords in that key and their “harmonic function” are derived from the scale degrees. 
The I chord is the chord with its root on the 1&#x302; scale degree, 
the V chord has its root on the 5&#x302;, and so on. 
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="harmony-intro" %} for more information about how scales are “harmonized”. 

Scales can be immensely helpful for understanding music *intellectually*. 
This understanding can guide our practice so that we intentionally develop useful habits and intuitions about sounds and how to produce them. 
(Practice time is governed by intellect; 
performance time is governed by habit and intuition.)

But practicing scales can also be dangerous. 
The danger is that when scales are practiced by rote, 
the creative and inquisitive mind gets lulled to sleep. 
Mindless repetition of scales digs deep ruts of habit in our nervous system, 
which makes improvisation sound mechanical and boring. 
It can be hard to avoid this trap. 

## Practicing scales without sounding like a robot 

To way to avoid sabotaging ourselves into sounding like a robot is to *always be mindful* when practicing scales. 
We have to think about each note as we play it. 

For example, what note is it? 
Which scale degree? 
What’s the interval from the tonic? 
What’s the interval from the root of the chord? 
How does it sound and feel in this context? 
(If it sounds really good, play it again!)

It’s not necessary to think about *all* of this for each note, 
but it’s critical to think about *something*; 
to engage our brain and not just our fingers.

This also means we have to slow down. 
There’s no time to think about each note if we’re shredding at top speed.
Perhaps surprisingly, 
practicing slowly and intentionally like this is actually the most effective way to develop speed. 
At performance time, with the analytical mind mostly turned off, 
our fingers are unleashed to repeat the habits that we’ve formed during practice. 
And if the habits are deep, it’s surprising how fast we can execute them.

The trick is to form the intended habits, 
which sound good to our ear and which carefully exclude sloppiness and mistakes.
