## What scales are good for---and bad for

### Scales tell us what the notes are

Scales are the foundation of harmony and melody.
Every key is derived from a scale.
The notes in the key are the notes of the scale, 
and the chords in the key are harmonized from the scale.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="harmony-intro" %} for details.

Scales can be immensely helpful for understanding music by *reason*. 
When practice time is governed by reason,
and performance time is governed by habit and intuition,
an understanding of scales can guide our practice so we develop useful habits and intuitions about sounds and how to produce them. 

### Scales are habit-forming

But practicing scales can also be dangerous. 
The danger is that when scales are practiced by rote, 
the creative and inquisitive mind gets lulled to sleep. 
Mindless repetition of scales digs deep ruts of habit in our nervous system, 
which makes improvisation sound mechanical and boring. 
It can be hard to avoid this trap.

The way to avoid accidentally programming ourselves into scale-playing robots is to *always be mindful* when practicing scales. 
We have to think about each note as we play it,
and slow down to give ourselves time to do so.

## What is a scale

A scale is an ordered collection of tones.

The tones in a scale are numbered in order,
from lowest pitch to highest. 
These numbers are called “scale degrees”.
The first degree of a scale is called the “tonic”.
The other degrees are named for their interval from the tonic.

Most scales in Western music are "diatonic",
which means they have seven notes,
with five whole tone intervals and two semitones
spaced as far apart as possible.

The **major scale** is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 3-4 and 7-1.
Canonically, all the major scale degrees are major or perfect intervals. 

**Major scale degrees and intervals**

|1|2|3    |4|5|6|7    |1|
|T|T|**S**|T|T|T|**S**| |

</div>

In other words,
- from 1 there's a whole tone to 2,
a major second from the tonic,
- then a whole tone to 3, 
a major third from the tonic,
- then a **semitone** to 4, 
a perfect fourth,
- a whole tone to 5,
a perfect fifth,
- a whole tone to 6,
a major sixth,
- a whole tone to 7,
a major seventh, and
- a **semitone** back to 1.

For another example, 
the **natural minor scale** is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 5-b6.

## Assembling scales on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

    class="chord row"
%}

{% include figure.html
    caption="C natural minor scale on second string."
    url="/assets/figures/natural-minor-scale/natural-minor-2.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

## Assembling scales across strings

Assembling a scale across strings requires knowing where to find semitone and whole tone intervals on neighboring strings.
Remember the intervals are the same between all strings (a perfect fourth),
except the "third rail" major third interval between strings 2-3.

Interval shapes that cross the third rail are 
diminished one semitone when approached from the left,
and augmented one semitone when approached from the right. 

{% include figure.html
    caption="Semitone and whole tone on neighboring strings."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/neighboring-st.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

{% include figure.html
    caption="Intervals on neighboring strings."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/neighboring-intervals.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

If it's hard to identify the jump back to the next scale degree at a glance,
it can help to count backwards. 
If we know where the 3 is on the neighboring string,
the T is two frets behind it,
and the S is one fret behind the T.

The major third shape may already be familiar,
since it's the shell of every major chord.
As shown in the diagram,
since most strings are tuned a perfect fourth apart,
the scale degree at the same fret on the neighboring string will be 4.
The major third is one fret lower.
Across the third rail (strings 3-2),
the major third is at the same fret.  

## CAGED scale forms

Scales are typically taught in a variety of "forms" or "shapes", 
with different teachers using different forms having often contradictory names.

This book focuses on scale forms based around CAGED chord shapes. 
This is practical because it integrates with the chords we are actually playing, 
and we gradually develop an understanding and muscle memory for chords and scales blended together. 
This blended intuition helps things flow when improvising.

Anchoring scales on CAGED roots also results in a clear and obvious way to name scale forms, 
like "C form" or "A form", 
rather than using ambiguous terms like "form 1" or "position 5-2".

To assemble a scale on a CAGED form,
put the first note of the scale on the lowest root of one of the CAGED chord shapes,
and assemble the scale across the strings without moving the hand out of position.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="caged" %} for more on CAGED chord shapes.

## Don't try to memorize scale shapes

Don't make any effort to memorize the shapes of dots or numbers on the fretboard.

Focus on the *intervals between the notes* instead.
How they sound, where to find them, what they mean.

The fingers will learn the shapes on their own,
automatically linked to the sounds and feelings of the intervals.

Practicing in this way strengthens neural pathways in the brain,
which can then be reused automatically at performance time.
It's like digging an irrigation ditch so that when the rain falls it is routed to water our plants.
Or like clearing a pathway in a forest that will later be run downhill in the dark.
