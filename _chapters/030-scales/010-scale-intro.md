## What scales are good for---and bad for

Scales are the foundation of harmony and melody.

Every key is derived from a scale, 
sometimes called its “parent scale”.
The notes in the key are the notes of the scale, 
and the chords in that key are constructed by "harmonizing" the scale.
(See {% include chapter-link.html slug="harmony-intro" %} for details.)

Scales can be immensely helpful for understanding music *intellectually*. 
Because practice time is governed by intellect,
and performance time is governed by habit and intuition,
understanding scales can guide our practice so that we develop useful habits and intuitions about sounds and how to produce them. 

But practicing scales can also be dangerous. 
The danger is that when scales are practiced by rote, 
the creative and inquisitive mind gets lulled to sleep. 
Mindless repetition of scales digs deep ruts of habit in our nervous system, 
which makes improvisation sound mechanical and boring. 
It can be hard to avoid this trap. 

## Practice mindfully 

The way to avoid accidentally programming ourselves into scale-playing robots is to *always be mindful* when practicing scales. 
We have to think about each note as we play it. 

For example, which note is it? 
Which scale degree? 
What’s the interval from the tonic? 
What’s the interval from the root of the chord? 
How does it sound and feel in this context? 
(If it sounds really good, play it again!)

It’s not necessary to think about *all* of this for each note, 
but it’s critical to think about *something*; 
to engage our brain and not just our fingers.

This also means we have to slow down when we practice scales. 
There’s no time to think about each note if we’re shredding at top speed.
Perhaps surprisingly, 
practicing slowly and intentionally like this is actually the most effective way to develop speed. 
At performance time, with the analytical mind mostly turned off, 
our fingers are unleashed to repeat the habits that we’ve formed during practice. 
And if the habits are deep, it’s surprising how fast we can execute them.

The trick is to form the intended habits during practice, 
which sound good to our ear and which carefully exclude sloppiness and mistakes. 

## What is a scale

A scale is an ordered collection of tones.

The tones in a scale are numbered in order,
from lowest pitch to highest. 
These numbers are called “scale degrees”.
The first degree of a scale is often called the “tonic”.

Most scales in Western music are "diatonic",
which means they have seven notes,
with five whole tone intervals and two semitones
spaced as far apart as possible. 

Scales can be described by a formula that specifies the whole tones (T) and semitones (S) between scale degrees.
For example, the **major scale** formula can be written like this: **TTSTTTS**.

Scales can also be described by the intervals of their scale degrees.
For example, the major scale, with all major and perfect intervals,
can be written like this: **1-2-3-4-5-6-7**.

The following table shows the **major scale** as both the T/S intervals between scale degrees and the interval of scale degrees. 

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| |T| |T| |S| |T| |T| |T| |S| |
|1| |2| |3| |4| |5| |6| |7| |1|

</div>

From 1&#x302; a whole tone to 2&#x302;, 
a whole tone to 3&#x302;, 
a semitone to 4&#x302;,
a whole tone to 5&#x302;,
a whole tone to 6&#x302;,
a whole tone to 7&#x302;,
and a semitone back to the 1&#x302;.
(Scale degree numbers are sometimes written with “hats” 
(1&#x302;).)

Since there are whole tones between most scale degrees,
the formula can be simplified by just specifying the location of the semitones.
For example, the major scale has semitones between 3&#x302;-4&#x302; and 7&#x302;-1&#x302;.

## CAGED scale forms

Scales are typically taught in a variety of "forms" or "shapes", 
with different teachers using different forms having often contradictory names.

This book focuses on scale forms based around CAGED chord shapes. 
This is practical because it integrates with the chords we are actually playing, 
and we gradually develop an understanding and muscle memory for chords and scales blended together. 
This blended intuition helps things really flow when improvising.

Anchoring scales on CAGED roots also results in a clear and obvious way to name scale forms, 
like "C form" or "A form", 
rather than using ambiguous terms like "form 1" or "position 5-2".

Put the first note of the scale on the lowest root of one of the CAGED chord shapes,
and find the notes across the strings without moving your hand out of position.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="caged" %} for more on CAGED chord shapes.
