- Hijaz (aka majorized phrygian, flamenco, gypsy major, phrygian dominant, etc.)
- Bebop scales (mixolydian or other 7-note scale with an added passing tone. The resulting 8-note scale allows fast 16th notes with chord tones on downbeats.)
- Jazz minor (ascending melodic minor) and its modes.
- Jazz guitarists will come across a variety of other scales that are beyond the scope of this book. But by this point, new scales should be easy to understand and absorb.
