## Practice mindfully 

The way to avoid accidentally programming ourselves into scale-playing robots is to *always be mindful* when practicing scales. 
We have to think about each note as we play it. 

For example, which note is it? 
Which scale degree?
What's the interval from the previous and next degrees?
What’s the interval from the tonic? 
What’s the interval from the root of the chord? 
How does it sound and feel in this context? 
(If it sounds really good, play it again!)

It’s not necessary to think about *all* of this for each note, 
but it’s critical to think about *something*; 
to engage our brain and not just our fingers.

This also means we have to slow down when we practice scales. 
There’s no time to think about each note if we’re shredding at top speed.
Perhaps surprisingly, 
practicing slowly and intentionally like this is actually the most effective way to develop speed. 
At performance time, with the analytical mind mostly turned off, 
our fingers are unleashed to repeat the habits that we’ve formed during practice. 
And if the habits are deep, it’s surprising how fast we can execute them.

The trick is to slowly and carefully form the intended habits during practice, 
which sound good to our ear and which carefully exclude sloppiness and mistakes.
It's like carving a rut into the dirt to direct the future flow of rain water to irrigate the crops.

## Focus on intervals, not shapes

Don't focus on the shapes of the notes on the fretboard.
Focus on the intervals of the scale degrees 
and assembling it in place.
This involves learning the intervals on the fretboard,
rather than scale shapes.

There are fewer interval shapes than scale shapes,
so it is faster to learn that way.
Meanwhile,
fingers learn the shapes on their own,
linked to the sounds and feelings of the intervals. 

Practice the scale, one form at a time: 
focus on intervals, not shapes. 
Play slowly ascending and descending to learn the intervals. 
Switch direction at any point to make melody fragments, 
play small licks and melodies that occur and repeat those that sound good. 
Play patterns and arpeggios. 

One scale at a time, 
one form at a time. 
Don’t rush. 
It’s a better investment of time to master just one (or a small handful of) forms, 
positions, and keys.

We should move on to the next form or scale when we get bored with the current one. 
Don’t be bored: one of the cardinal rules of practice. 

## Ascending and descending, slowly

From the tonic note,
thoughtfully assemble the scale from its intervals
as far as it can go ascending and descending.
Play slowly and mindfully,
knowing each note before moving on to the next.
Gradually learn where each interval is in this form.
Aim for perfection.
Any mistakes should be repeated over correctly many multiples of times.
Think of carving a niche in the dirt for irrigation,
or starting a saw cut in a piece of wood.

## Tunes and licks

While ascending or descending,
switch directions at will to prevent boredom and make little melodic phrases.
This may reveal tunes from long buried melodies in deep memories.
It can be surprising how many classical, 
folk, cultural,
and religious traditional songs 
consist largely of snippets of scales.

Sounds that we like should be replayed,
slowly, thoughtfully, and repeatedly,
so they will become part of our personal style.

## Patterns and arpeggios

- Thirds: Ascending thirds up and down, then descending thirds up and down
- 3-note diatonic arpeggios: ascending up and down, then descending up and down
- Cyclical quadruplets
- Common patterns (Bert Ligon's Connecting chords with linear harmony)
