### Ascending and descending, slowly

From the root note,
thoughtfully assemble the scale from its intervals
as far as it can go ascending and descending.
Play slowly and mindfully,
knowing each note before moving on to the next.
Gradually learn where each interval is in this form.
Aim for perfection.
Any mistakes should be repeated over correctly many multiples of times.
Think of carving a niche in the dirt for irrigation,
or starting a saw cut in a piece of wood.

### Tunes and licks

While ascending or descending,
switch directions at will to prevent boredom and make little melodic phrases.
This may reveal tunes from long buried melodies in deep memories.
It can be surprising how many classical, 
folk, cultural,
and religious traditional songs 
consist largely of snippets of scales.

Sounds that we like should be replayed,
slowly, thoughtfully, and repeatedly,
so they will become part of our personal style.

### Patterns and arpeggios



Practice the scale, one form at a time: 
focus on intervals, not shapes. 
Play slowly ascending and descending to learn the intervals. 
Switch direction at any point to make melody fragments, 
play small licks and melodies that occur and repeat those that sound good. 
Play patterns and arpeggios. 

One scale at a time, 
one form at a time. 
Don’t rush. 
It’s a better investment of time to master just one (or a small handful of) forms, 
positions, and keys.

We move on to the next form or scale when we get bored with the current one. 
Don’t be bored: one of the cardinal rules of practice. 


- Scale: Play up and down the string
- Thirds: Ascending thirds up and down, then descending thirds up and down
- Full diatonic arpeggios: ascending and descending
- 3-note diatonic arpeggios: ascending up and down, then descending up and down
- Diatonic melodies

- Cyclical quadruplets
- Common patterns (Bert Ligon's Connecting chords with linear harmony)
