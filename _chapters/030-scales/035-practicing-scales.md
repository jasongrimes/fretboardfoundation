abstract: Effective scale practice sounds good.

Practice the scale, one form at a time: 
focus on intervals, not shapes. 
Play slowly ascending and descending to learn the intervals. 
Switch direction at any point to make melody fragments, 
play small licks and melodies that occur and repeat those that sound good. 
Play patterns and arpeggios. 

One scale at a time, 
one form at a time. 
Don’t rush. 
It’s a better investment of time to master just one (or a small handful of) forms, 
positions, and keys.

We move on to the next form or scale when we get bored with the current one. 
Don’t be bored: one of the cardinal rules of practice. 


- Scale: Play up and down the string
- Thirds: Ascending thirds up and down, then descending thirds up and down
- Full diatonic arpeggios: ascending and descending
- 3-note diatonic arpeggios: ascending up and down, then descending up and down
- Diatonic melodies

- Cyclical quadruplets
- Common patterns (Bert Ligon's Connecting chords with linear harmony)
