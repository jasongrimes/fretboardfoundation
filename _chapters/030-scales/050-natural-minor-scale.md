abstract: The natural minor, or "Aeolean" mode, is the foundation of minor key tonality. It can also be the gateway to internalizing modes and chord/scale relationships.

## About the natural minor scale

The natural minor scale is the basis for minor key harmony.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="minor-harmony" %} for details. 

It is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 5-b6.

| |T|S |T|T|S |T |T|
|1|2|b3|4|5|b6|b7|1|
|C|D|Eb|F|G|Ab|Bb|C|

</div>

This pattern is also called the "Aeolian" mode,
the sixth mode of the major scale.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="diatonic-modes" %} for more information.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

## Relative major and minor

The notes in a natural minor scale are identical to the notes in the relative major scale a minor third above it. 
For example, the notes and chords in A natural minor are the same as in C major.
C is said to be the *relative major* of Am,
and Am is said to be the *relative minor* of C.

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">
**C major**

| |T|T|S|T|T|T|S|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|1|
|C|D|E|F|G|A|B|C|

</div>


<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">
**A natural minor**

| |T|S |T|T|S |T |T|
|1|2|b3|4|5|b6|b7|1|
|A|B|C |D|E|F |G |A|

</div>

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">
**C major laid over relative minor**

|            | |T|T|S|T|T|T|S |T|T|S |T |T|T|S|
|            |C|D|E|F|G|A|B|C |D|E|F |G |A|B|C|
|C major     |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|1 |2|3|4 |5 |6|7|1|
|A nat. minor| | | | | |1|2|b3|4|5|b6|b7|1| | |

</div>

Notice that the 1 of the relative minor is the 6 of the relative major.
The natural minor is the sixth *mode* of the major scale.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="diatonic-modes" %} for details.

This is a quick way to get started learning notes in a minor key. 
By learning a major key we get the relative minor for free.

Also compare the relative major form with the exact same notes,
but different intervals.

## Practicing natural minor

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="practicing-scales" %} for general information about practicing scales.

### Practice as relative major

When first getting familiar with a minor key,
play the scale for its relative major, 
starting and ending on the 6.
Get a sense of the 6 as the tonal center.

### Practice as minor

Once the sound of the scale is familiar,
start thinking of the minor key tonal center as 1,
and play the same exercises with this new point of view.

### Think in both minor and relative major

It can be constructive to switch perspective back and forth,
thinking of a tone as a degree of both the minor scale and the relative major.

## Whole fretboard

The first figure shows the A natural minor scale on the whole fretboard,
in standard tuning.
Compare the second figure,
the relative major scale,
C major.
The two scales have the same notes and intervals,
but different scale degrees from different tonics.
