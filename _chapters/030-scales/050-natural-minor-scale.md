abstract: The natural minor, or "Aeolean" mode, is the foundation of minor key tonality. It can also be the gateway to internalizing modes and chord/scale relationships.

## About the natural minor scale

The natural minor scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 5-b6.

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| |T|**S**|T |T|**S**|T |T |
|1|2    |b3|4|5    |b6|b7|1|
|C|D    |Eb|F|G    |Ab|Bb|C|

</div>

This pattern is also called the "Aeolian" mode,
the sixth mode of the major scale.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="diatonic-modes" %} for more information.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

## Tetrachords

Here are the two tetrachords of the natural minor scale.

## Relative major and minor

The notes in a natural minor scale are identical to the notes in the relative major scale a minor third above it. 
For example, the notes and chords in A natural minor are the same as in C major.

This is a quick way to get started learning notes in a minor key: by learning a major key we get the relative minor for free.

## E form

{% include figure.html

    url="/assets/figures/natural-minor-scale/natural-minor-E.svg"
    class="chord row"

Also compare the relative major form with the exact same notes,
but different intervals.

    class="chord row"
%}

## Practicing scale forms

Stay on the E form and learn as much as possible before moving on to another form.
Move on when it becomes boring, 
but not before.
Practice slowly and thoughtfully,
first ascending and descending, 
then with tunes, licks, scale patterns and arpeggios.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="practicing-scales" %} for details.

## Whole fretboard

The first figure shows the A natural minor scale on the whole fretboard,
in standard tuning.
Compare the second figure,
the relative major scale,
C major.
The two scales have the same notes and intervals,
but different scale degrees from different tonics.
