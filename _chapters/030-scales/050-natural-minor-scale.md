abstract: The natural minor, or "Aeolean" mode, is the foundation of minor key tonality. It can also be the gateway to internalizing modes and chord/scale relationships.

## About the natural minor scale

The natural minor scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 5-b6.

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

|1|2    |b3|4|5    |b6|b7|1|
|T|**S**|T |T|**S**|T |T | |

</div>

This pattern is also called the "Aeolian" mode,
the sixth mode of the major scale.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="diatonic-modes" %} for more information.

## Assembling on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

## Assembling across strings

Assembling a scale across strings requires knowing where to find semitone and whole tone intervals on neighboring strings.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="scale-intro" %} for details.
