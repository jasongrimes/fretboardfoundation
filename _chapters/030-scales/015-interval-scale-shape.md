## Basic interval shape

This shape is special because every possible minor or diminished interval is located one fret below its corresponding major or perfect interval,
without having to cross strings.
This allows easy comparison of the intervals in any scale shape.

## Comparing scales

The major scale maps perfectly onto the interval shape.
Or the interval shape is an awkward form of the major scale.

But compare the natural minor scale, with minor third, sixth, and seventh intervals.
It's easy to see the natural minor has a minor third,
since it's a fret below the third interval shape.
