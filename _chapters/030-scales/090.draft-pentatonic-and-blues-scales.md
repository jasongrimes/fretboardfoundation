## About pentatonic scales

### Ancient and worldwide 

Pentatonic scales were developed independently by many ancient civilizations.

This may be because the five notes are acoustically linked by simple pitch ratios,
perfect fourths and fifths,
and can be constructed by stacking five fifths.

Often,
cultures that developed pentatonic modes used a system of tuning called "just intonation",
in which tones occur naturally as a result of the overtone series,
but which unfortunately results in each key having slightly different intervals.
Modern instruments use "equal tempered" tuning instead,
and only instruments like the guitar which support "microtones" by bending strings 
can attempt to perform tunes composed in just intonation.


### No semitones

The pentatonic scales most commonly used in the world contain no semitones
(they are "anhemitonic").

They can be played using only the black keys on a piano keyboard.

### No dissonant intervals

Compared to diatonic scales,
the two notes removed from pentatonic scales to eliminate the semitones
are also the two notes that form a tritone interval with each other
(4-7, 2-b6, etc.).

The absence of the two most dissonant intervals in Western music,
the tritone and the semitone,
make these pentatonic scales highly consonant.
