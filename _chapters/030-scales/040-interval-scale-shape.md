## Basic interval shape

This shape is special because every possible minor or diminished interval is located one fret below its corresponding major or perfect interval,
without having to cross strings.
This allows easy comparison of the intervals in any scale shape.

## Comparing scales

The **major scale** maps perfectly onto the interval shape.
Or the interval shape is an awkward form of the major scale.

Compare the **natural minor scale**, 
with minor third, sixth, and seventh intervals,
which are easy to see next to the major third, 
sixth, and seventh intervals in the major scale shape.

Also compare the **harmonic minor** with a major seventh,
and the **ascending melodic minor** aka **jazz minor** with just a minor third.

## Repeating shapes

In addition to its use for comparing scales,
this shape can be an interesting way to ascend or descend the fretboard.
