## About minor scales

### Melodic minor scale

The melodic minor scale is a seven note scale 
created by raising the sixth degree of the harmonic minor scale.
The purpose of this is to get rid of the tone-and-a-half interval between b6 and 7 in the harmonic minor scale,
because it sounds unidiomatic and alien to Western harmony.

The melodic minor scale is often used for minor key melodies.
In euroclassical pieces it is typically played ascending,
in order to move from the leading tone to the tonic,
but then the natural minor scale with b7 and b6 is played descending,
since the leading tone is no longer needed
and there is no longer a foreign tone-and-a-half interval for which to adjust the b6. 

The melodic minor scale has a b3,
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 7-1.

### Harmonic minor scale 

The harmonic minor scale is a seven note scale 
created by raising the seventh degree of the natural minor scale
to create a leading tone.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="minor-harmony" %} for details.

The harmonic minor scale has semitones between degrees 2-b3, 5-b6, and 7-1,
and a tone-and-a-half interval (TS, 3 semitones) between b6 and 7.
It has a b3 and a b6.

### Natural minor scale

The natural minor scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 5-b6.
It has a b3, b6, and b7.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

## Assemble across strings

Assembling a scale across strings requires knowing where to find semitone and whole tone intervals on neighboring strings.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="scale-intro" %} for details.

## Practicing scale forms

Stay on the E form and learn as much as possible before moving on to another form.
When it becomes boring from familiarity
is the time to move on. 

Practice like any scale form.
Slowly and thoughtfully,
first ascending and descending, 
then with tunes, licks, scale patterns and arpeggios.

## Whole fretboard

The first figure shows the A natural minor scale on the whole fretboard,
in standard tuning.
Compare the second figure,
the relative major scale,
C major.
The two scales have the same notes and intervals,
but different scale degrees from different tonics.
