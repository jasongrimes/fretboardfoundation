## About melodic, harmonic, and natural minor

The **melodic minor scale** is a seven note scale 
created by raising the sixth degree of the harmonic minor scale
to smooth out the unidiomatic tone-and-a-half interval.
It has a b3,
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 7-1.

The **harmonic minor scale** is a seven note scale 
created by raising the seventh degree of the natural minor scale.
It has semitones between degrees 2-b3, 5-b6, and 7-1,
and a 1.5 tone interval (TS, 3 semitones) between b6 and 7.
It has a b3 and a b6.

The **natural minor scale** is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 5-b6.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

## Compare minor scales

## Assemble across strings

Assembling a scale across strings requires knowing where to find semitone and whole tone intervals on neighboring strings.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="scale-intro" %} for details.

{% include figure.html
    caption="Relative major scale in G CAGED form."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/major-G.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

## Practicing scale forms

Stay on the E form and learn as much as possible before moving on to another form.
When it becomes boring from familiarity
is the time to move on. 

Practice like any scale form.
Slowly and thoughtfully,
first ascending and descending, 
then with tunes, licks, scale patterns and arpeggios.

## Whole fretboard

The first figure shows the A natural minor scale on the whole fretboard,
in standard tuning.
Compare the second figure,
the relative major scale,
C major.
The two scales have the same notes and intervals,
but different scale degrees from different tonics.
