## About minor key tonality

### The leading tone

Minor key tonality often uses the leading tone (major 7 degree),
in spite of the fact that the natural minor scale has a b7.
Natural minor with a major 7 is called the harmonic minor scale.
In a minor key, 
when approaching the tonic from below,
it is common to approach it through the leading tone, 7-1.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="minor-harmony" %} for details.

### The flat six

Using the leading tone 7 results in 
a tone-and-a-half interval between the b6 and 7 in the harmonic minor scale. 
This is an uncommon sound in Western music,
carrying a connotation of "otherness" or "foreignness",
and euroclassical composers preferred to avoid scale intervals larger than a whole tone. 
This was done in minor keys 
by either raising the b6 degree to 6,
called the (ascending) melodic minor scale,
or by playing a b7 and b6 when descending and the leading tone is not needed,
which is the natural minor scale. 

In short, the melodic, harmonic, and natural minor scales are defined by
these choices about whether to raise or lower the sixth and seventh scale degrees.

## About minor scales

### Melodic minor scale

The melodic minor scale is a seven note scale 
created by raising the sixth degree of the harmonic minor scale.
The purpose of this is to get rid of the tone-and-a-half interval between b6 and 7 in the harmonic minor scale,
because it sounds unidiomatic and alien to Western tonality.

The melodic minor scale is often used for minor key melodies.
In euroclassical pieces it is typically played ascending,
in order to move from the leading tone to the tonic,
but then the natural minor scale with b7 and b6 is played descending,
since the leading tone is no longer needed
and there is no longer a foreign tone-and-a-half interval for which to adjust the b6. 

In jazz, 
the melodic minor scale is used both ascending and descending,
and minor key melodies usually use the major 6 and 7.
In jazz, melodic minor is sometimes called "real melodic minor",
and it is given primacy as a minor scale.
It is even harmonized,
and the various modes of melodic minor are commonly used in jazz.

The melodic minor scale has a b3,
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 7-1.

### Harmonic minor scale 

The harmonic minor scale is a seven note scale 
created by raising the seventh degree of the natural minor scale
to create a leading tone.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="minor-harmony" %} for details.

The harmonic minor scale has semitones between degrees 2-b3, 5-b6, and 7-1,
and a tone-and-a-half interval (TS, 3 semitones) between b6 and 7.
It has a b3 and a b6.

### Natural minor scale

The natural minor scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 5-b6.
It has a b3, b6, and b7.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

## Assemble across strings

Assembling a scale across strings requires knowing where to find semitone and whole tone intervals on neighboring strings.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="scale-intro" %} for details.

## Practicing scale forms

Stay on the E form and learn as much as possible before moving on to another form.
Move on as soon as it becomes boring,
but not before.

Practice like any scale form.
Slowly and thoughtfully,
first ascending and descending, 
then with tunes, licks, scale patterns and arpeggios.

## Whole fretboard

The first figure shows the A natural minor scale on the whole fretboard,
in standard tuning.
Compare the second figure,
the relative major scale,
C major.
The two scales have the same notes and intervals,
but different scale degrees from different tonics.
