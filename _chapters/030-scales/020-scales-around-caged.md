Scales are typically taught in a variety of "forms" or "shapes",
with different teachers using different forms having contradictory names.

This book focuses on scale forms based around CAGED chord shapes.
This is practical because it integrates with the chords we are actually playing,
and we gradually develop an understanding and muscle memory for chords and scales blended together.
This blended intuition helps things really flow when improvising.

Anchoring scales on CAGED roots also results in a clear and obvious way to name scale forms,
like "C form" or "A form",
rather than using ambiguous terms like "form 1" or "position 5-2".

The approach is simple enough. 
When practing a scale,
start with the first note of the scale on the lowest root of one of the CAGED chord shapes,
and find the notes across the strings without moving your hand out of position.
