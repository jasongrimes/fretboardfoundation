Scales are typically taught in a variety of "positions",
with different teachers using different positions having contradictory names.

This book focuses on scale positions based around CAGED chord shapes.
This is practical because it integrates with the chords we are actually playing,
and we gradually develop an understanding and muscle memory for chords and scales blended together.
This blended intuition helps things really flow when improvising.

Anchoring scales on CAGED roots also results in a clear and obvious way to name scale positions,
rather than using ambiguous terms like "position 1".

The approach is simple enough. 
When practing a scale,
start with the first note of the scale on the root of one of the five CAGED chord shapes,
and find the notes across the strings without moving your hand out of position.
Notice when a scale tone matches one of the chord tones.
