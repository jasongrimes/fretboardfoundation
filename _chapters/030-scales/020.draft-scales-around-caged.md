Scales are typically taught in a variety of different "positions",
with different teachers using different positions with contradicting names.

This book focuses on scale positions based around CAGED chord shapes.
This is practical because it integrates with the chords you are actually playing,
and you gradually develop an understanding and muscle memory for chords and scales blended together.
This blended intuition helps things really flow when improvising.

This is also a clear and obvious way to name scale positions,
rather than using ambiguous terms like "position 1", etc.

The approach is simple enough. 
When practing a scale,
start with the first note of the scale on the root of one of the five CAGED chord shapes,
and find the notes across the strings without moving your hand out of position.
Notice when a scale tone matches one of the chord tones.
