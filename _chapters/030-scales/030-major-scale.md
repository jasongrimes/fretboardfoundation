## About the major scale

The major scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 3-4 and 7-1.
Canonically, all the major scale degrees are major or perfect intervals. 

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| |T|T|**S**|T|T|T|**S**|
|1|2|3    |4|5|6|7    |1|
|C|D|E    |F|G|A|B    |C|

</div>

This pattern is also called the "Ionian" mode.
It is one of the most common musical modes in the world,
and it has been the basis of Western harmony for at least 400 years.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

Here is the major scale on one string.

    class="chord"
%}

## Tetrachords

Here are the two tetrachords of the major scale.

    caption="Major scale tetrachords"
    url="/assets/figures/tetrachords/major-tetrachords.svg"
    class="string row"
%}

Both tetrachords of a major scale are the same,
with intervals **1-2-3-4** (**T-T-S**).
This is sometimes called the *major tetrachord*.

## E form

Here is the major scale assembled in CAGED E form.

The E form is also a treble triad with first string root.

{% include figure.html
    caption="Major scale in E CAGED form."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/major-E.svg"
    class="chord"
%}

Fingering is straightforward in this form.
Start with the second finger on the sixth string tonic. 

## Practicing scale forms

Stay on the E form and learn as much as possible before moving on to another form.
When it becomes boring from familiarity
is the time to move on. 

Practice slowly and thoughtfully,
first ascending and descending, 
then with tunes, licks, scale patterns and arpeggios.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="practicing-scales" %} for details.
