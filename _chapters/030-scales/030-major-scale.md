## About the major scale

The major scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 3-4 and 7-1.
Canonically, all the major scale degrees are major or perfect intervals.

|1|2|3    |4|5|6|7    |1|
|T|T|**S**|T|T|T|**S**| |

</div>

This pattern is also called the "Ionian" mode.
It is one of the most common musical modes in the world,
and it has been the basis of Western harmony for at least 400 years. 

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="major-harmony" %} for more information.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

## Assemble across strings

Assembling a scale across strings requires knowing where to find semitone and whole tone intervals on neighboring strings.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="scale-intro" %} for details.

## Practicing this scale

### Don't try to memorize scale shapes

Don't try to memorize scale shapes.
Focus on the *intervals between the notes* instead.
How they sound, where to find them, what they mean.
The fingers will learn the shapes on their own,
automatically linked to the sounds and feelings of the intervals.

### Ascending and descending, slowly

From the root note,
thoughtfully assemble the scale from its intervals
as far as it can go ascending and descending.
Play slowly and mindfully,
knowing each note before moving on to the next.
Gradually learn where each interval is in this form.
Aim for perfection.
Any mistakes should be repeated over correctly many multiples of times.
Think of carving a niche in the dirt for irrigation,
or starting a saw cut in a piece of wood.

### Tunes and licks

While ascending or descending,
switch directions at will to prevent boredom and make little melodic phrases.
This may reveal tunes from long buried melodies in deep memories.
It can be surprising how many classical, 
folk, cultural,
and religious traditional songs 
consist largely of snippets of scales.

Sounds that we like should be replayed,
slowly, thoughtfully, and repeatedly,
so they will become part of our personal style.
