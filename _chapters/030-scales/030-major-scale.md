## About the major scale

The major scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 3-4 and 7-1.
Canonically, all the major scale degrees are major or perfect intervals.

## The Ionian mode

This pattern is also called the "Ionian" mode.
It is one of the most common musical modes in the world,
and it has been the basis of Western harmony for at least 400 years. 

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="major-harmony" %} for more information.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

Here is the major scale on one string.

    class="chord"
%}

Notice that the 8-note scale 
is composed of two identical 4-note "tetrachords",
with intervals T-T-S (1,2,3,4 and 5,6,7,1).
This is called the Ionian tetrachord.

## Assemble across strings

Assembling a scale across strings requires knowing where to find semitone and whole tone intervals on neighboring strings.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="scale-intro" %} for details.

Here is the major scale assembled in CAGED E form.

## E form

E form is also a first string root treble triad 
I chord on a first-string tonic.

{% include figure.html

    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/major-E.svg"
    class="chord"
%}

Don't focus on the shapes of the notes in the E form.
Focus on assembling it in place from anywhere on the fretboard,
given a starting scale degree.
This involves learning the intervals on the fretboard,
rather than scale shapes.
There are fewer interval shapes than scale shapes,
so it is faster to learn that way.
Meanwhile,
our fingers learn the shapes on their own,
linked to the sounds and feelings of the intervals.
