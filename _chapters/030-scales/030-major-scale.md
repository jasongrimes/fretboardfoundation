## About the major scale

The major scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 3-4 and 7-1.
Canonically, all the major scale degrees are major or perfect intervals.

|1|2|3    |4|5|6|7    |1|

This pattern is also called the "Ionian" mode.
It is one of the most common musical modes in the world,
and it has been the basis of Western harmony for at least 400 years. 

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="major-harmony" %} for more information.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

## Assemble across strings

Assembling a scale across strings requires knowing where to find semitone and whole tone intervals on neighboring strings.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="scale-intro" %} for details.
