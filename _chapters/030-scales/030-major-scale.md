## About the major scale

The major scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 3-4 and 7-1.
Canonically, all the major scale degrees are major or perfect intervals.

This pattern is also called the "Ionian" mode.
It is one of the most common musical modes in the world,
and it has been the basis of Western harmony for at least 400 years. 

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="major-harmony" %} for more information.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

Here is the major scale on one string.

    class="chord"
%}

## Tetrachords

A 7-note scale with the tonic repeated at the octave
can be split into two 4-note sequences called "tetrachords".

Here are the two tetrachords of the major scale.

{% include figure.html
    caption="Major scale first tetrachord."
    url="/assets/figures/tetrachords/tetrachord-1234.svg"
    class="uke-chord row"
%}

{% include figure.html
    caption="Major scale second tetrachord."
    url="/assets/figures/tetrachords/tetrachord-5671.svg"
    class="uke-chord row"
%}

This is called the Ionian tetrachord.

## Assemble across strings

Assembling a scale across strings requires knowing where to find semitone and whole tone intervals on neighboring strings.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="scale-intro" %} for details.

{% include figure.html
    caption="Semitone and whole tone on neighboring strings."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/neighboring-st.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

{% include figure.html
    caption="Intervals on neighboring strings."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/neighboring-intervals.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

## E form

Here is the major scale assembled in CAGED E form.

The E form is also a treble triad with first string root.

{% include figure.html
    caption="Major scale in E CAGED form."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/major-E.svg"
    class="chord"
%}

Fingering is straightforward in this form.
Start with the second finger on the sixth string tonic. 

## Practicing scale forms

Stay on the E form and learn as much as possible before moving on to another form.
When it becomes boring from familiarity
is the time to move on. 

Practice like any scale form.
Slowly and thoughtfully,
first ascending and descending, 
then with tunes, licks, scale patterns and arpeggios.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="practicing-scales" %} for details. 

## D form

## C form

{% include figure.html
    caption="Major scale in C CAGED form."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/major-C.svg"
    class="chord"
%}

## A form

{% include figure.html
    caption="Major scale in A CAGED form."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/major-A.svg"
    class="chord"
%}

## G form

{% include figure.html
    caption="Major scale in G CAGED form."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/major-G.svg"
    class="chord"
%}

## Whole fretboard
