## About the major scale

The major scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 3-4 and 7-1.
Canonically, all the major scale degrees are major or perfect intervals.

## The Ionian mode

This pattern is also called the "Ionian" mode.
It is one of the most common musical modes in the world,
and it has been the basis of Western harmony for at least 400 years. 

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="major-harmony" %} for more information.

## Assemble on one string

The simplest way to visualize a scale is on a single guitar string.
The scale semitones and tones are one and two frets apart.

Here is the major scale on one string.

    class="chord"
%}

Notice that the 7-note scale plus the octave
is composed of two identical 4-note "tetrachords",
with intervals T-T-S (1,2,3,4 and 5,6,7,1).
This is called the Ionian tetrachord.

## Assemble across strings

Assembling a scale across strings requires knowing where to find semitone and whole tone intervals on neighboring strings.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="scale-intro" %} for details.

{% include figure.html
    caption="Semitone and whole tone on neighboring strings."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/neighboring-st.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

{% include figure.html
    caption="Intervals on neighboring strings."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/neighboring-intervals.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

## E form

Here is the major scale assembled in CAGED E form.

The CAGED E form is also a treble triad with first string root.

{% include figure.html
    caption="Major scale in E CAGED form."
    url="/assets/figures/major-scale/major-E.svg"
    class="chord"
%}

Focus on the scale intervals and assembling the scale in place,
rather than focusing on the shapes of the notes on the fretboard.

## Practicing the scale forms

Stay on the E form and learn as much as possible before moving on to another form.
When this form becomes boring from familiarity,
that's when it's time to move on. 

Practice like any scale form.
Slowly and thoughtfully,
first ascending and descending, 
then with tunes, licks, scale patterns and arpeggios.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="practicing-scales" %} for details.
