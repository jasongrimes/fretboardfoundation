## About minor key tonality

### The leading tone

In a minor key,
it is common to approach the tonic from a half-step below,
from 7-1,
through the major 7&#x302; or leading tone.
This is so even though the natural minor scale does not contain a major 7&#x302; degree.
Natural minor with a leading tone major 7&#x302; is called the *harmonic minor* scale.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="minor-harmony" %} for details.

### The tone-and-a-half interval

The use of the leading tone 7&#x302; results in 
a tone-and-a-half interval between the b6&#x302; and 7&#x302;. 

This tone-and-a-half interval (aka augmented second, #2, TS) is an uncommon sound in Western music,
connoting "otherness" or "foreignness",
and euroclassical composers preferred to avoid it. 
Instead,
when composing melody lines in minor keys,
they would either (1) raise the b6&#x302; degree to 6&#x302;,
which is called the (ascending) melodic minor scale,
or (2) use both b7&#x302; and b6&#x302; when descending and the leading tone is not needed,
which is the natural minor scale. 

### Adjustable 6 and 7

By definition, 
the third degree of a minor scale is always a minor third.

But the sixth and seventh scale degrees in minor tonality can be thought of as adjustable.
They can be major or minor,
depending on the circumstances.

While the different permutations are labeled as melodic, harmonic, and natural minor scales,
it can be more helpful to think of them as one general minor scale,
with an adjustable sixth and seventh as needed.

## About minor scales

### Melodic minor scale

The melodic minor scale is a seven note scale 
created by raising the sixth degree of the harmonic minor scale,
to get rid of the tone-and-a-half interval between b6 and 7.

The melodic minor scale is often used for minor key melodies.
In euroclassical pieces it is traditionally played ascending,
in order to move from the leading tone to the tonic,
but then the natural minor scale with b7 and b6 is played descending,
since the leading tone is no longer needed
and there is no longer a foreign tone-and-a-half interval for which to adjust the b6. 

In jazz, 
the melodic minor scale is used both ascending and descending,
and minor key melodies usually use the major 6 and 7.
Jazz musicians sometimes call the ascendending melodic minor scale "real minor".
It is given primacy as a minor scale,
and is even harmonized,
with the various modes of melodic minor being commonly used in jazz pieces.

The melodic minor scale has a b3,
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 7-1.

### Harmonic minor scale 

The harmonic minor scale is a seven note scale 
created by raising the seventh degree of the natural minor scale
to create a leading tone. 
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="minor-harmony" %} for details.

The harmonic minor scale has semitones between degrees 2-b3, 5-b6, and 7-1,
and a tone-and-a-half interval (TS, 3 semitones) between b6 and 7.
It has a b3 and a b6.

### Natural minor scale

The natural minor scale is a seven note diatonic scale 
with semitones between degrees 2-b3 and 5-b6.
It has a b3, b6, and b7.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="natural-minor-scale" %} for details.

Natural minor is also the *Aeolian mode*,
the sixth diatonic mode of the major scale.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="diatonic-modes" %} for details.

### Combined minor scale

It can be helpful to think in terms of a single combined minor scale,
with adjustable sixth and seventh degrees.

## Practicing scale forms

When practicing,
try to think in the combined form of the scale,
adjusting the sixth and seventh degrees as appropriate.

For example,
use the major 7&#x302; leading tone instead of the b7&#x302;
when approaching the tonic from below.
Even when approaching the tonic from above,
it can sound good to slide into the tonic with the leading tone.
For example: **5-4-b3-2-7-1**.

When playing both the sixth and seventh degrees,
be mindful of the potential tone-and-a-half interval if there's a b6 and major 7.
Either avoid it,
by lowering the 7 or raising the 6,
or embrace it---it can be a cool sound.

Even if this amounts to just practicing the melodic, harmonic, and natural minor scales separately,
try to think in terms of the adjustable sixth and seventh degrees.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="practicing-scales" %} for more recommendations about practicing these forms.
