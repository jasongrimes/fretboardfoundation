title: Diatonic modes
slug: diatonic-modes
abstract: The diatonic modes are the seven modes of the major scale, including the major ("Ionian") and natural minor ("Aeolian") already covered. Each of the other five modes differs from Ionian or Aeolian by a single tone, which is the source of the mode's unique sound and feel.

## What are diatonic modes

The diatonic modes are the seven rotations of the major scale, 
each starting at a different degree of the major scale 
and wrapping around the end to the beginning.

For example,
the first mode of C major has the notes `C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C`.
The second mode of C major has the notes `D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D`,
and the third mode `E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E`.

While the different modes have the same notes, 
by starting on a different note they have a different tonal center,
and the scale degree intervals are different because they are measured from a different note as 1&#x302;.
This gives each mode a different sound and feel.

Each mode is intimately linked to the corresponding chord in the harmonized major scale.
For example,
the second mode is the scale that underlies the ii chord,
and the fifth mode is the scale under the V chord.
The sound and feel of each mode is the sound and feel of the corresponding chord.

Diatonic modes are named with obscure Greek-related terms that make little sense and just have to be memorized.
Starting with the first degree of the major scale,
the diatonic modes are
(1) Ionian,
(2) Dorian,
(3) Phrygian,
(4) Lydian,
(5) Mixolydian,
(6) Aeolian (the natural minor scale), and 
(7) Locrian.

A mnemonic to help remember the modes is "I Don't Punch Like Mohammed A-Li".

## Reference modes

A simple way look at modes is to first determine if they are major or minor
(having a 3&#x302; or b3&#x302;)
and then compare them to a major or minor "reference mode".

Ionian is the major scale,
so it's the major reference mode.

Aeolian is the natural minor scale.
It's the reference against which all minor modes can be compared.

Each of the other modes differs from Ionian or Aeolian by only a single tone,
which is responsible for the mode's unique sound and feel.

### (1) Ionian - major

{% include figure.html
    caption="C Ionian mode tetrachords on 5th and 6th strings."
    url="/assets/figures/modes/C-ionian.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

Since the Ionian mode is the same as the major scale,
it's the ultimate reference mode.
All scales in Western music are implicitly compared against this mode,
because every degree is a major or perfect interval.
Minor intervals can be found one fret below the major ones.

Compare any tetrachord to this mode to quickly identify the intervals of its scale degrees. 

### (6) Aeolian - minor
