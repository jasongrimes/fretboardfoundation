abstract: The diatonic modes are the seven modes of the major scale, including the major ("Ionian") and natural minor ("Aeolian") already covered. Each mode describes the harmonic environment of the corresponding chord in a major key.

## What are diatonic modes

The diatonic modes are the seven rotations of the major scale, 
each starting at a different degree of the major scale 
and wrapping around the end to the beginning.

For example,
the first mode of C major has the notes `C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C`.
The second mode of C major has the notes `D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D`,
and the third mode `E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E`.

While the different modes have the same notes, 
by starting on a different note they have a different tonal center,
and the scale degree intervals are different because they are measured from a different note as 1&#x302;.
This gives each mode a different sound and feel.

Each mode is intimately linked to the corresponding chord in the harmonized major scale.
For example,
the second mode is the scale that underlies the ii chord,
and the fifth mode is the scale under the V chord.
The sound and feel of each mode is the sound and feel of the corresponding chord.

Diatonic modes are named with obscure Greek-related terms that make little sense and just have to be memorized.
Starting with the first degree of the major scale,
the diatonic modes are
(1) Ionian,
(2) Dorian,
(3) Phrygian,
(4) Lydian,
(5) Mixolydian,
(6) Aeolian (the natural minor scale), and 
(7) Locrian.

A mnemonic to help remember the modes is "I Don't Punch Like Mohammed A-Li".

## Reference modes

A simple way get familiar with modes is to first determine if they are major or minor
(having a 3&#x302; or b3&#x302;)
and then compare them to a major or minor "reference mode".

Ionian, the major scale,
is the major reference mode.

Aeolian, the natural minor scale,
is the minor reference mode.

Each of the other modes differs from Ionian or Aeolian by only a single tone,
which creates the mode's unique sound and feel.

### (1) Ionian - major

{% include figure.html
    caption="Ionian mode tetrachords"
    url="/assets/figures/tetrachords/major-tetrachords.svg"
    class="string row"
%}

Since the Ionian mode is the major scale,
it's the ultimate reference mode.
All scales in Western music are implicitly compared against this mode,
because it describes every major and perfect interval.
Minor intervals can then be found one fret below the major ones.

Compare any tetrachord to this mode to quickly identify the intervals of its scale degrees. 

The Ionian mode should be memorized.
It allows us to immediately identify the interval between any two notes up to an octave apart on the fretboard.

### (6) Aeolian - minor

{% include figure.html
    caption="Aeolian mode tetrachords"
    url="/assets/figures/tetrachords/natural-minor-tetrachords.svg"
    class="string row"
%}

The Aeolian mode is the natural minor scale.

It describes the harmonic environment of the vi chord
(or the i chord in a minor key).

**Aeolian has a b3, b6, and b7**,
compared to the Ionian mode.

The b3 is the sound of a minor mode.

The b7 is a whole tone below the tonic rather than being a leading tone.
The absence of a leading tone is the cause of all the mischief with harmonic and melodic minor scales.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="minor-scales" %}
for details.

To get familiar with the sound of the Aeolian mode,
play a vi chord in a major key,
then starting from the root note of the vi chord,
6&#x302;,
continue the major scale up to the 6&#x302; an octave above,
`6-7-1-2-3-4-5-6`
(remembering the semitone between 3-4 and 7-1),
and then play another vi chord.
Improvise for awhile within those notes,
making a point of dwelling on the 6&#x302; as "home".

Assembling modes in this way is easier than memorizing the shapes of all the modes on the fretboard.
We just have to memorize the major scale and the Ionian tetrachord.

Compare the assembled tetrachords to Ionian to quickly identify the intervals.



To hear the sound of this mode in the key of C major,
play an Am chord with its root on the open 5th string,
assemble the tetrachord by continuing the major scale from the root of the chord,
as shown in the diagram.
Then play another Am.
