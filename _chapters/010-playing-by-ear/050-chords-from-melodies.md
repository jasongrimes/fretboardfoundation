Adding chords to a melody makes it sound fuller and more complete.

When playing a melody on the highest pitched string,
there are some easy ways to add chords and fill out the harmony.

One approach is to play *power chords* on the top two strings,
stopping both strings at the same fret.
The note on the second string is a perfect fifth interval above the note on the first string,
which creates a power chord,
having two of the three notes of a major or minor triad chord.
For the most part,
if a power chord is played on a scale tone,
it will be a diatonic (in tune) chord.

Another way to fill out top string melodies 
is to add a bass note on the lowest-pitched (6) string.
The 1 and 6 strings are tuned to the same note in different octaves,
so playing the same note on the 6 string sounds like adding a bass note.
It doesn't sound good for a bass line to be played in unison with the melody line too much,
but it can be helpful at occasional but regular intervals to provide a simple bass line.

Treble triads can be good chords for adding to melody lines.
