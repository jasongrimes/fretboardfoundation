Adding chords to a melody makes it sound fuller,
more like a complete song.

There are some easy tricks for adding chords and bass notes when playing a melody on the highest pitched string.

A *power chord* can be played on the top two strings,
By stopping both strings at the same fret.
This power chord has its root on the highest (1st) string
and it's perfect fifth on the 2nd string. 
These are two of the three notes of a major or minor triad chord.
For the most part,
a power chord is played on a scale tone
will be "in tune" (diatonic).

Another way to fill out melodies 
is to add a bass note on the lowest-pitched (6th) string
by playing the note at the same fret as the 1st string. 
The 1st and 6th strings are tuned to the same note in different octaves.
It doesn't sound good for a bass line to be played in unison with the melody line too much,
but it can sound good occasionally.

For more flexibility adding chords to melodies,
learn treble triads.
