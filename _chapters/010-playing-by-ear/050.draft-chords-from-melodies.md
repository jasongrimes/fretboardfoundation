Interspersing chords with a melody makes it sound fuller,
more like a complete song.

When playing a melody on the highest pitched string,
there are some easy ways to fill out the harmony.

One way to add chords to a melody on the top string
is to play *power chords* on the top two strings,
stopping both strings at the same fret.
The note on the second string is a perfect fifth interval above the note on the first string,
which is a power chord or P5 chord.
The power chord fits with any major or minor chord,
so as long as it is played on one of the scale tones,
it will be a diatonic (in tune) chord.

Another way to fill out top string melodies 
is to add a bass note on the lowest-pitched (6) string.
The 1 and 6 strings are tuned to the same note in different octaves,
so playing the same note on the 6 string sounds like adding a bass note.
It doesn't sound good for a bass line to be played in unison with the melody line too much,
but it can be helpful at occasional but regular intervals to provide a simple bass line.

Treble triads can be good chords for adding to melody lines.
