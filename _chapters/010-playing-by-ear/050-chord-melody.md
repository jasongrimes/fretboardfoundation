Blending together chords and melody makes a composition sound fuller and richer,
like a song rather than just a part. 

There are some quick tricks for filling out a melody on the highest pitched string.

For example, a *power chord* can be played on the top two strings,
by stopping both strings at the same fret.
This power chord has its root on the highest (1st) string
and it's perfect fifth on the 2nd string. 
These are two of the three notes of a major or minor triad chord.
For the most part,
a power chord played on a scale tone
will be "in tune" (diatonic).

Another way to fill out melodies 
is to add a bass note on the lowest-pitched (6th) string
by playing the note at the same fret as the 1st string. 
The 1st and 6th strings are tuned to the same note in different octaves.
This can be effective when done on the first beat of a phrase,
though it doesn't sound good for a bass line to be played in unison with the melody line too much.
