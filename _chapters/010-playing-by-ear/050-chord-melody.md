Guitar chord melody improvisation has fascinated me since childhood.
The ability to freely interweave chord progressions,
melodies, and bass lines
always seemed the ultimate in guitar performance.

Blending together chords and melody makes a composition sound fuller and richer, 
like a song rather than just a part.

*Treble triads* can be used to improvise freely with chords. 
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="treble-triads" %}.

A small trick for filling out a melody on the highest pitched string
is to play the first and second strings at the same fret,
a little two-note chord called a *power chord* or *double stop*.
For the most part,
a power chord played on a scale tone
will be "in tune" (diatonic).

Another way to fill out melodies 
is to add bass notes on the lower strings.

A trick to give the impression of a bass line is to duplicate a melody note from the 1st string onto the 6th string as a bass note.
This can be effective when done sparely,
such as on the first beat of a phrase,
but it doesn't sound good to play a bass line in unison with the melody too much.

Add more variety to the bass line by playing fifths, octaves, and approach tones.
