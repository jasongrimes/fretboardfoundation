Chord melody improvisation may be the richest form of expression on guitar.
It involves freely interweaving chord progressions,
melodies, and bass lines in a fluid and captivating way.
Blending together chords and melody makes a composition sound fuller and richer, 
like a complete performance rather than just a part.

*Treble triads* can be used to improvise freely with chords. 
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="caged" %}.

A small trick for filling out a melody on the highest pitched string
is to play the first and second strings at the same fret,
a little two-note chord called a *power chord* or *double stop*.
For the most part,
a power chord played on a scale tone
will be "in tune" (diatonic).

Another way to fill out melodies 
is to add bass notes on the lower strings.

A trick to give the impression of a bass line is to duplicate a melody note from the 1st string onto the 6th string as a bass note.
This can be effective when done sparely,
such as on the first beat of a phrase,
but it doesn't sound good to play a bass line in unison with the melody too much.

Add more variety to the bass line by playing fifths, octaves, and approach tones.
