Guitar chord melody improvisation has fascinated me since an early age.
The ability to freely interweave chord progressions,
melodies, and bass lines
was always the dream for me.
I saw it as the ultimate capability on guitar.

Blending together chords and melody makes a composition sound fuller and richer,
like a song rather than just a part. 

A quick trick for filling out a melody on the highest pitched string
is to play a *power chord* or *double stop* on the top two strings,
by stopping both strings at the same fret.
This power chord has its root on the highest (1st) string
and its perfect fifth on the 2nd string. 
These are two of the three notes of a major or minor triad chord.
For the most part,
a power chord played on a scale tone
will be "in tune" (diatonic).

*Treble triad* chords can provide more freedom in chord improvisation.

Another way to fill out melodies 
is to add bass notes on the lower strings.
Melody notes on the highest-pitched (1st) string can also be played on the lowest-pitched (6th) string,
since the 1st and 6th strings are tuned to the same note in different octaves.
This can be effective when done on the first beat of a phrase,
though it doesn't sound good for a bass line to be played in unison with the melody line too much.
To add more variety to the bass line,
