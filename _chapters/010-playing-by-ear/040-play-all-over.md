Once we can play a melody on both one string and across strings,
it's natural to combine approaches and play all over the fretboard.

We can follow a melody up and down a string,
and then turn a corner and play across strings for awhile.

This free ability to range all over the instrument can be liberating and fun.
The eloquent Mick Goodrick calls it "the realm of the electric ice-skating rink"
[(1987, p. 30)](references#goodrick-1987).
The guitar's full tonal capabilities have been opened.

When skating around the fretboard,
orientation becomes important.
It's useful to have landmarks to locate where we are on the fretboard and where we want to go.

Look at the dots on the fretboard to identify the location of a fret.
Sometimes it helps to think of the fret number and string number coordinates,
to focus the mind.
Try to remember meaningful locations.
Remembering fretboard locations
lets us return to where we were,
and recognize where we arrive.

Orientation can be helped by knowing the names of some of the notes on the fretboard.
