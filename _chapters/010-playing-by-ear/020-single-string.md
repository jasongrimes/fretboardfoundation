In _The Advancing Guitarist_, 
Mick Goodrick puts it beautifully.

"Playing on a single string is absolutely the most logical place to begin on a guitar.
Consider the following observations:

* The simplest way to see notes is in a straight line.
* A single string *is* a straight line.
* On a single string, there is a direct relationship between interval distance and movement in space.
* ...The problem of changing strings is eliminated.
This simplifies the right hand function and displays the principles of left hand function in their purest form.
* Different types of phrasing and articulations can be played very consistently.
* Elements of fundamental theory can be shown to a beginner in clear and simple visual and aural terms:
intervals, scale constructions, chords, arpeggios, etc.
The same could be said for dynamics, articulations, and timbre."
[(Goodrick, 1987, p. 10)](references#goodrick-1987)

Playing on one string also has the effect that we don't have to worry about being in tune,
to the extent that a string is always in tune with itself.

We can always pick up any random stringed instrument in any random junk shop.
No matter how well or poorly maintained,
no matter how old or in disrepair,
as long as the instrument has one string that can vibrate,
we can make music on a single string.

And everyone knows how to do this.
We don't have to be trained.
We just know on some level how to make music with a vibrating string.
