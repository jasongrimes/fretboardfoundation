title: Play on a single string
slug: single-string
abstract: The most natural way to find the next note is also the easiest way to move up and down the fretboard.

In _The Advancing Guitarist_, 
Mick Goodrick puts it beautifully.

"Playing on a single string is absolutely the most logical place to begin on a guitar.
Consider the following observations:

* "The simplest way to see notes is in a straight line.
* A single string *is* a straight line.
* On a single string, there is a direct relationship between interval distance and movement in space.
* Playing on a single string helps to eliminate two potential problems: "paralysis" (fear of movement)
and "acrophobia" (fear of higher frets),
since the entire lenth of the fingerboard is utilized from the very beginning.
* ...Elements of fundamental theory can be shown to a beginner in clear and simple visual and aural terms:
intervals, scale constructions, chords, arpeggios, etc.
The same could be said for dynamics, articulations, and timbre."
[(Goodrick, 1987, p. 10)](references#goodrick-1987)

Playing on one string also has the effect that we don't have to worry about being in tune,
in the sense that a string is always in tune with itself.

We can pick up a random stringed instrument in any random junk pile.
No matter how well or poorly maintained,
how old or in disrepair,
as long as the instrument has one string that can vibrate,
it can make music.

And everyone knows how to do this.
We don't have to be trained.
We just know on some level how to make music with a vibrating string.
