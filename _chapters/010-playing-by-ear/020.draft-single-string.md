In _The Advancing Guitarist_, 
Mick Goodrick puts it beautifully.

> Playing on a single string is absolutely the most logical place to begin on a guitar.
> Consider the following observations:
>
> * The simplest way to see notes is in a straight line.
> * A single string *is* a straight line.
> * On a single string, there is a direct relationship between interval distance and movement in space.
> * Playing on a single string helps to eliminate two potential problems:
> "paralysis" (fear of movement) and "acrophobia" (fear of higher frets),
> since the entire length of the fingerboard is utilized from the very beginning.
> * This approach is conducive to learning note locations because you can't rely on a fingering pattern (as in position playing).
> * The problem of changing strings is eliminated.
> This simplifies the right hand function and displays the principles of left hand function in their purest form.
> * Different types of phrasing and articulations can be played very consistently.
> * Elements of fundamental theory can be shown to a beginner in clear and simple visual and aural terms:
> intervals, scale constructions, chords, arpeggios, etc.
> The same could be said for dynamics, articulations, and timbre.
