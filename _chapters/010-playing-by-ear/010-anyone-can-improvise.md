Anyone can make music on a guitar,
from the first moment we hold one. 
Even if we have no training,
even if we have never seen a guitar in our lives,
the guitar shows us how right away. 
All we need is the will to create something beautiful, 
and an ear to listen.

## What is improvisation

Improvisation means playing off the top of our head,
"extemporaneously",
or "without time" to prepare.

Improvisation involves an element of novelty---some 
unique expression that only we could make---but that 
doesn't necessarily mean coming up with an entirely original composition
(if there is such a thing).
We can play parts of tunes written by others,
flowing from one bit to the next on a whim,
floating on a stream of consciousness,
adding our own embellishments as we are moved to do so. 

## Why improvise

It’s worth bearing in mind that the whole point of all this is to create music.
To create art, to express ourselves, to make our novel contribution to the universe.
And in order to do so,
to play the guitar with the same freedom as one might sing.

We can make art without first mastering the art form. 
The reason to study and practice music
is to make better music.
The music is the point,
not the theory or the practice.

Every practice should begin and end with the improvisation of music.

## The first note

The first note can be literally anything. 
A tune can be played in any key.
Or we can slide up and down the string to find an exact starting pitch. 

## The next note

Finding the next note is like a game. 
It’s like making an educated guess. 
We can use any information we already know to inform our guess,
but often it’s best not to think at all and just let our fingers choose.
Then
pause,
listen,
adjust.

## The melody

Try to pick out a short melody.
Whatever comes first to mind,
something simple and short. 
It’s hard at first,
random and full of wrong notes.
But it gets easier,
the wrong notes fewer,
as we explore, 
listen and learn.

## Some tricks

There are some tricks that can make it easier to improvise in this way. 

- If we are unsure what a note is going to sound like, 
we can play it quietly at first,
to get our bearings,
before playing louder with a more certain note. 

- Finding an “in” note is almost as good as finding the “right” note. If we land on a note that wasn’t intended but which is still “in” the key,
it still sounds musical,
and we can treat it as a “melodic approach” to our intended note. 

- By the law of chance, any note picked at random is going to be “in” most of the time (58%, 7/12 chance). 

- Any note that is “out” is only one fret away in either direction from being “in”,
so we can treat it as a “chromatic approach" into an "in" note,
like we did it on purpose,
and shift “in” by a fret in the chosen direction. 

- From an “in” note, 
the next closest “in” note is most likely two frets away (70%, 5/7 chance). 
If the next “in” note is only one fret away,
we can often feel it “pulling” to resolve.
If we *don’t* feel this pull,
we should try going two frets in either direction and see what happens.

And a trick for blending in with other musicians:
differences in tuning and intonation between instruments can sometimes be covered with *vibrato*. 
A note doesn’t have to be perfectly in tune if it is passing back and forth 
(vibrating) through the perfect pitch.
