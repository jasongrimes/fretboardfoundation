Anyone can make music on a guitar,
from the first moment we hold it. 
Even if we have no training,
even if we have never seen a guitar in our lives,
the guitar shows us how right away. 
All we need is the will to create something beautiful, 
and an ear to listen.

## Why improvise

It’s worth bearing in mind that the point of all of this is to create music.
To create art, beauty, expression.

An art form need not be mastered before creating the art. 
The reason for study and practice
is the hope of making more beautiful music.
The music is the point,
not the theory or practice.

Every practice should begin and end with the creation of music.


## The first note

The first note can be literally anything. 
A tune can be played in any key.
Or we can slide up and down the string to find an exact starting pitch. 

## The next note

Finding the next note is like a game. 
It’s like making an educated guess. 
We can use any information we already know to inform our guess,
but often it’s best not to think at all and just let our fingers choose.
Then:
pause,
listen,
adjust.

## The melody

Try to pick out a short melody.
Whatever comes first to mind,
something simple and short. 
It’s hard at first,
random and full of wrong notes.
But it gets easier,
the wrong notes fewer,
as we explore, 
listen and learn.

## Some tricks

There are some tricks that can make it easier to improvise in this way. 

If we are unsure what a note is going to sound like, 
we can play it quietly at first,
to get our bearings,
before playing a more certain note louder. 

Finding an “in” note is almost as good as finding the “right” note. If we land on a note that wasn’t intended but which is still “in” the key,
it still sounds musical,
and we can treat it as a “melodic approach” to our intended note. 

By the law of chance, any note picked at random is going to be “in” most of the time (58%, 7/12 chance). 

Any note that is “out” is one fret either direction from being “in”,
so we can treat it as a “chromatic approach" into an "in" note,
like we did it on purpose. 
Own it,
maybe lower its volume,
and then deliberately step “in” by a fret in a chosen direction. 

From an “in” note, 
the next closest “in” note is most likely two frets away (70%, 5/7 chance). 
If the next “in” note is only one fret away,
we can often feel it “pulling” to resolve.
If we *don’t* feel this pull,
we should try going two frets in either direction and see what happens.

Vibrato is a good way to cover up tuning and intonation issues. 
A string or note doesn’t have to  be perfectly in tune if it is vibrating back and forth above the in-tune pitch.
