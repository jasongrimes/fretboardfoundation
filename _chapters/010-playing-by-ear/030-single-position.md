abstract: Playing a melody across the strings means navigating the guitar's tuning. 
---

After exploring a melody on a single string,
try playing the same melody across strings,
without moving the fretting hand out of position.

The tuning of the guitar affects where the notes are found on neighboring strings.
On a guitar in standard tuning,
all the strings are tuned the same distance apart with one exception,


When picking out a melody across strings,
it can be helpful to know that 
the interval between every string is the same
(a perfect fourth)
with one exception. 
The exception is the "third rail"---the 
major third interval between strings 2--3.
Intervals that cross the third rail are 
diminished one semitone when approached from the left,
and augmented one semitone when approached from the right.
