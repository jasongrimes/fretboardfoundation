abstract: Playing a melody across the strings means navigating the guitar's tuning.

## Playing in position

After thoroughly exploring a melody on a single string,
try playing the same melody across strings,
without moving the fretting hand out of position.

## Neighboring strings and intervals

The tuning of the guitar affects where the notes are found on neighboring strings.

On a guitar in standard tuning,
it quickly becomes apparent that
all the strings are tuned the same distance apart except strings 2-3.

(Strings on a guitar are numbered from 1-6 with 1 as the highest pitched string (high E)
and 6 the lowest (low E).)

## Perfect fourths and fifths

On a guitar in standard tuning,
all the strings except 2-3 are tuned a "perfect fourth" interval apart,
when played ascending,
which is also a "perfect fifth" apart when descending.
The interval between the 2-3 strings is a "major third",
which is arguably the most crucial interval in Western harmony. 

These perfect fifth,
perfect fourth,
and major third intervals are some of the most fundamental musical sounds in the world,
and have been used for millenia as the core intervals of Western tonality.

By gently exploring tones on neighboring strings at the same fret,
we can begin to feel how the strings relate to each other
and draw out these familiar sounds.


## Finding tones across strings

At first,
picking out a melody across strings seems like a matter of random guessing,
and then remembering what we find.
It gets easier over time.
It's like a memory game that never resets.

One way to get better at it is to study scales.
