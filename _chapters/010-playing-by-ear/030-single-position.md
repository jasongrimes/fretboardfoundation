abstract: Playing across strings without moving the fretting hand out of position.

Once playing on a single string has been explored,
try playing the same melody in a position.
Move across strings,
instead of up and down the fretboard.

Be aware of the "third rail",
the major third interval between strings 2--3,
different from the perfect fourth interval between all the other strings in standard tuning. 
Intervals that cross the third rail are one semitone diminished when approached from the left,
and augmented one semitone when approaches from the right.
