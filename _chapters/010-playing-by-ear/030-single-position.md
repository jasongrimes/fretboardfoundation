abstract: Playing across strings without moving the fretting hand out of position.

Once playing on a single string has been explored,
try playing the same melody in a position.
Move across strings,
instead of up and down the fretboard.

Be aware of the "third rail",
the major third interval between strings 2--3,
different from the perfect fourth interval between all the other strings in standard tuning.
