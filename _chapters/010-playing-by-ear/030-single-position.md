abstract: Playing a melody across the strings means navigating the guitar's tuning. 
---

After exploring a melody on a single string,
try playing the same melody across strings,
without moving the fretting hand out of position.

The tuning of the guitar affects where the notes are found on neighboring strings.
On a guitar in standard tuning,
all the strings are tuned the same distance apart except strings 2-3.
This quickly becomes obvious.

At first,
finding notes across strings is a matter of random guessing,
and then remembering what we find.
It gets easier over time.
It's like a memory game that never resets.

One way to get better at it is to study scales.
