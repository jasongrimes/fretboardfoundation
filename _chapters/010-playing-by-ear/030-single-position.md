title: Play across strings 
slug: melody-one-position
abstract: Playing a melody across the strings means navigating the guitar's tuning. 
---

After exploring a melody on a single string,
try playing the same melody across strings,
without moving the fretting hand out of position.

The tuning of the guitar affects where the notes are found on neighboring strings.
On a guitar in standard tuning,
all the strings are tuned the same distance apart with one exception.
If the guitar strings are numbered from 1 to 6
with 1 the highest and 6 the lowest pitched strings,
the difference in pitch between strings 2 and 3 is slightly less than between all the other strings. 
This "third rail" affects every melody that crosses it. 

Intervals that cross the third rail are 
diminished (lowered) one semitone (fret) when approached from the left,
and augmented (raised) one semitone (fret) when approached from the right.
