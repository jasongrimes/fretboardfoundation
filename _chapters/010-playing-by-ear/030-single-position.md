Once playing on a single string has been explored,
try playing the same melody in a position.
Move across strings,
instead of up and down the fretboard.

When picking out a melody across strings,
it can be helpful to know that 
the interval between every string is the same
(a perfect fourth)
with one exception. 
The exception is the "third rail"---the 
major third interval between strings 2--3.
Intervals that cross the third rail are 
diminished one semitone when approached from the left,
and augmented one semitone when approached from the right.
