## Playing in position

After thoroughly exploring a melody on a single string,
try playing the same melody across strings,
without moving the fretting hand out of position.

This is called "position playing".

## Finding notes across strings

At first,
picking out a melody across strings seems like a matter of random guessing,
and then remembering what we find.
It gets easier over time.
It's like a memory game that never resets.

The following figures show where notes are located on neighboring strings.

Every pair of neighboring strings has the same relationship between their notes,
**except between strings 2 and 3**.
While all the other guitar strings are tuned to pitches the same distance apart,
there is a slightly smaller difference in pitch between strings 2 and 3.

## Intervals between strings

The differences in pitch between the strings on a guitar are carefully chosen to be some of the most fundamental sounds in music. 
Differences in pitch are called "intervals".

The interval between a string and its neighbor to the left (except 2-3) is called a "perfect fifth".
It's the most common musical sound in the world 
(partly because it is the dominant harmonic in the "overtone series", [see glossary](glossary.html)).

The interval between the 3rd and 2nd string is called a "major third".
It's arguably the most important sound in Western harmony.
Between them,
the root, major third, 
and perfect fifth intervals compose a major chord.
Lowering the major third by one fret turns it into a minor chord.

These major and minor "triad chords" are the most common chords used in all of Western harmony.

There are many of these three-note triad chords around the fretboard.
Listen and explore to find them.
The following figures show some examples.
