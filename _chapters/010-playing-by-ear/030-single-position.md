## Playing in position

After thoroughly exploring a melody on a single string,
try playing the same melody across strings,
without moving the fretting hand out of position.

## Finding notes across strings

At first,
picking out a melody across strings seems like a matter of random guessing,
and then remembering what we find.
It gets easier over time.
It's like a memory game that never resets.

The following figure shows how to find the next highest or lowest pitched notes on neighboring strings.
Play around with it to get the idea.

Studying scales makes it easier to find notes across strings.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="scale-intro" %} for details.

## Neighboring strings and intervals

The tuning of the guitar affects where the notes are found on neighboring strings.

On a guitar in standard tuning,
it quickly becomes apparent that
all the strings are tuned the same distance apart except strings 2-3 
(strings are numbered 1-6 from lowest pitch to highest).

## Thirds, fourths and fifths

On a guitar in standard tuning,
all the strings except 2-3 are tuned a "perfect fourth" interval apart,
when played ascending,
which is also a "perfect fifth" apart when descending.
The interval between the 2-3 strings is a "major third",
which is arguably the most crucial interval in Western harmony. 

These perfect fifth,
perfect fourth,
and major third intervals are some of the most fundamental musical sounds in the world,
and have been used for millenia as the core intervals of Western tonality.

By gently exploring tones on neighboring strings at the same fret,
we can begin to feel how the strings relate to each other
and draw out these familiar sounds.

The following chord diagrams show examples of how triad chord intervals fall on neighboring strings.
