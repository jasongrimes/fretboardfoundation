Jason Grimes has been playing guitar off and on for more than 30 years. 
He's self-taught and likes to do things his own way. 
He enjoys improvising, studying, and analyzing things from multiple perspectives. 

Having taken many long breaks from music over the years, 
and then having to relearn everything when he returned,
has given him some insight into the most practical things worth knowing about the guitar, 
and the fastest ways to learn them.

He is a software developer by profession. 
He considers himself fortunate to be able to do music for love, 
not money---all art and no commerce. 
His aim is to freely share anything he's learned about music
with anyone in the world who might find it useful.
