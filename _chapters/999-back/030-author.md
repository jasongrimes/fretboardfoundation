## Jason Grimes

I have been playing guitar off and on for more than 30 years. 
I’m self-taught and I like to do things my own way. 
I enjoy improvising, studying, and analyzing things from multiple perspectives. 

I’ve taken many long breaks from music over the years, 
and then had to relearn everything when I returned to it. 
I like to think this gives me some insight into the most practical things worth learning about the guitar, 
and the fastest ways to (re)learn them.

I’m a software developer by trade. 
I am fortunate to be able to do music for love, 
not money---all art and no commerce. 
My aim is to freely share anything I’ve learned about music that might be useful, 
with anyone in the world who might want it.
