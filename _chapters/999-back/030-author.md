Jason Grimes has been playing guitar for over 30 years. 
He's self-taught and likes to do things his own way. 
He enjoys improvising, studying, and analyzing things from multiple perspectives. 

Having taken many long breaks from music over the years, 
and then needing to relearn everything when he returned,
he likes to think he has some insight into the most practical things worth knowing about the guitar, 
and the fastest ways to learn them.

He is a software developer by profession. 
He considers himself fortunate to be able to play music for love and
not money. 
His aim is to condense, clarify, and share
the things he's learned about music that might be useful to others.
