Jason Grimes has been playing guitar off and on for more than 30 years. 
He's self-taught and likes to do things his own way. 
He enjoys improvising, studying, and analyzing things from multiple perspectives. 

He has taken many long breaks from music over the years, 
and then had to relearn everything when he returned to it. 
He likes to think this gives him some insight into the most practical things worth learning about the guitar, 
and the fastest ways to (re)learn them.

He is a software developer by profession. 
He considers himself fortunate to be able to do music for love, 
not money---all art and no commerce. 
His aim is to freely share anything he's learned about music that might be useful,
and make it available to anyone in the world who might want it.
