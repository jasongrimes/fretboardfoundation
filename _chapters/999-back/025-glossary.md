Many of these definitions are taken nearly verbatim from the well-reasoned terminology choices in Philip Tagg's 
_Everyday Tonality II (towards a tonal theory of what most people hear)_ [(Tagg, 2018)](references#tagg-2018),
to which this book is indebted. Errors and omissions are, of course, mine. 

- **atonal**{:#atonal}: Music or other sounds without [tones](#tone).
In common usage,
it can also refer to music that is [non-tonical](#non-tonical).

- **chromatic**{:#chromatic}: Notes outside of the [diatonic](#diatonic) [mode](#mode) or scale upon which a composition is based.

- **diatonic**{:#diatonic}: Conforming to a seven-note [mode](#mode) or scale which,
when arranged in ascending order with the initial note repeated at the octave,
contains intervals of two half steps (semitones)
and six whole steps (whole tones).
Also used to refer to notes that are inside a diatonic mode,
as opposed to [chromatic](#chromatic) notes which are outside the mode.

- **diatonic mode**{:#diatonic-mode}: One of seven permutations of a [diatonic](#diatonic) scale,
with each permutation starting on a different degree of the scale and wrapping around to the beginning as needed. 
Starting with the first degree of the major scale (the Ionian mode),
the other diatonic modes are Dorian, 
Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (the natural minor scale), and Locrian. 
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="diatonic-modes" %}.

- **fundamental pitch**{:#fundamental-pitch}: The lowest frequency (or "partial") of a sound wave (which also contains various "overtones" or "harmonics" at multiples above the fundamental frequency).
See [overtone series](#overtone-series). 

- **interval**{:#interval}: The difference in [pitch](#pitch) between two [tones](#tone).

- **modal**{:#modal}: Music which has the characteristics of a [mode](#mode).
Also commonly used to refer to music based on one of the 5 [diatonic modes](#diatonic-mode) 
*other than* the Ionian (major) or Aeolian (minor).

- **mode**{:#mode}: A type of scale which results from distilling a tonal vocabulary down to a set of individual tones,
normally arranged in ascending order and delimited by scale degree 1 (1&#x302;, the [tonic](#tonic)) at the bottom and top of one 
[octave](#octave), coupled with a set of characteristic melodic and harmonic behaviors, motifs, and turns of phrase.

- **non-tonical**{:#non-tonical}: Music without a [tonic](#tonic).

- **note**{:#note}: Any single, discrete sound of finite duration in music.

- **note name**{:#note-name}: One of the first seven letters of the English alphabet (A-G)
and any necessary accidental (flat or sharp)
used to designate [notes](#note) of a standard fundamental pitch (like A at 440 Hz).

- **octave**{:#octave}: The [interval](#interval) between one [pitch](#pitch) and another with double its frequency.
Notes separated by octaves have the same [note name](#note-name) and [pitch class](#pitch-class).

- **overtone series**{:#overtone-series}: Aka "harmonic series".
A tone sung or played at a particular pitch consists of sound waves oscillating at a particular frequency (its fundamental pitch),
but it also includes overtones or harmonics (aka partials) oscillating at integral multiples of the fundamental.
The overtone series is the sequence of these overtones, 
expressed as intervals from the fundamental.
The first five overtones in the series are: octave, perfect fifth, octave, major third, perfect fifth.
Notice that the first three distinct pitches in the overtone series form a major triad chord,
which helps explain why it is the most common chord in Western music.
The fifth is the most common (or dominant) overtone that sounds different from the fundamental,
which is why the fifth degree of a major scale is called the "dominant".
How strongly which harmonics are present in a given tone is an essential aspect of [timbre](#timbre).

- **pitch**{:#pitch}: The aspect of a sound determined by the rate of vibrations producing it---its acoustic frequency.
Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz).

- **pitch class**{:#pitch-class}: A set of all [pitches](#pitch) that are a whole number of [octaves](#octave) apart.
For example, the pitch class C consists of all the Cs in all octaves.

- **scale**{:#scale}: An ordered collection of [tones](#tone). 
Similar to a [mode](#mode),
but without mode's implication of characteristic musical applications.

- **timbre**{:#timbre}: *(pronounced /ˈtambər/)* aka "tone quality" or "tone color". A complex acoustic phenomenon allowing us to 
distinguish between two [notes](#note), *[tonal](#tonal) or otherwise*, sounded at the same [pitch](#pitch) and volume.

- **tonal**{:#tonal}: In common usage,
"tonal" refers to music that has a [tonic](#tonic).
Philip Tagg makes a convincing argument that this usage is chauvinistic and biased against tonal idioms not used in the euroclassical or jazz canons 
[(Tagg, 2018, pp. 52--55)](references#tagg-2018),
recommending the term "[tonical](#tonical)" for this purpose,
and using "tonal" to refer to any music which has the properties of a [tone](#tone) 
(including [modal](#modal) music, which is [non-tonical](#non-tonical) but not [atonal](#atonal)).
This book generally follows these recommendations.

- **tone**{:#tone}: A [note](#note) with an easily discernible fundamental [pitch](#pitch). 

- **tonic**{:#tonic}: A noun meaning *keynote or reference pitch*. Its adjective is [tonical](#tonical) (recommended) 
or [tonal](#tonal) (in common usage).

- **tonical**{:#tonical}: Music that has a tonic. Compare [tonal](#tonal).
