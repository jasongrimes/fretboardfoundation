## Octaves and scientific pitch notation

To distinguish between the same note in different octaves,
"scientific pitch notation" adds an octave number to the note name.

C4 is "middle C",
the C in between the bass and treble clefs,
and near the middle of a piano keyboard.

B4 is the B above middle C,
and B3 is the B below middle C.

The lowest note on guitar is E2
(the open low E string),
and the highest is around E5
(the 12th fret on the high E string).
