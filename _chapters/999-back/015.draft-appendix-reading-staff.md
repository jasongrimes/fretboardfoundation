title: "Appendix II: Reading music staff notation for guitar"

For purposes of music notation,
the guitar is considered a "transposing" instrument,
and more specifically, 
an "octave-displaced" one.

This means that staff notation for guitar is written an octave higher than it sounds,
so that the full range of notes available to guitar can fit easily on a single treble staff.

The treble clef on a guitar staff should be written with a little "8" below it,
to indicate this octave displacement.
Often,
guitar sheet music leaves out this annotation,
but it is always implied.
