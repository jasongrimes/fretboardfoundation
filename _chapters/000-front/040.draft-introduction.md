## Learning music on guitar

A vibrating string is an excellent vehicle for the study of music,
as has been well known since at least Ancient Greece
when philosopher, mathematician, 
and music theorist Pythagoras studied them over 2000 years ago.
The guitar is therefore a great instrument on which to explore fundamental musical concepts,
like pitch, intervals, and harmony.

There are some basic differences when studying music on guitar versus a more traditional instrument like the piano.

Transposition is easier on guitar than on other instruments,
because different keys can often be played with the same fingerings at a different fret.
It's therefore less important on guitar to devote equal practice to all 12 keys.

Musical staff notation is not as well suited to guitar as it is to other instruments like piano,
in part because on guitar 
the exact same pitch can be found at multiple places on the fretboard.

As a result of these differences,
on guitar it can be more efficient to study music by focusing more on intervals,
and less on note names and staff notation.
