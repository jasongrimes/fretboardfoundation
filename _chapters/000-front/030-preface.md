## Why this book

This book exists to fill a gap I find in guitar instructional material. 
There are countless resources available for beginners, 
and there are excellent materials for advanced musicians with solid backgrounds in theory and practice.

But for those in-between, the “intermediate” guitarists, 
it can be a long, hard slog to master the instrument well enough to be able to really express oneself creatively. 

Most of the material targeting this group sorts into either jazz or euroclassical genres. 
Classical guitar instruction tends to focus on the precise reproduction of the composers’ intentions, 
with little emphasis on improvisation or creativity. 
Jazz digs deep into improvisation and music theory, 
but with techniques that often don’t translate well to other styles because of an emphasis on dissonance and seventh chords. 
And both approaches promise *at best* a long and winding road toward mastery, 
requiring years of study and a somewhat blind faith that it will lead where we want to go. 

The approach taken in this book is based on an idea of triage. 
In the long run, it would be ideal to learn everything. 
But for *right now*, given the overwhelming amount there is to learn, 
how can we make the most progress in the shortest time? 
What’s the minimum information needed, and what’s the fastest way to learn it?

Obviously the answer depends in part on where we want to go.
Our interests and our present circumstances will dictate our direction.
But there are common foundational elements that are often required.
This book aims to provide a practical way to acquire that foundation. 

## Who this book is for

If you are among the intended audience of this book, 
you might describe yourself as an “intermediate” guitarist. 
You can play some songs, and you know whatever you consider to be “the basics”. 
You can play chords, and maybe some scales. 
The subjects in this book sound at least vaguely familiar to you.

Most importantly, you want to make music on guitar, 
with a facility and a graceful freedom that allows you to express yourself creatively,
and produce the sounds you hear inside as directly and purely as possible. 

If this describes you, welcome.
I'm glad you're here.
Please read on.
