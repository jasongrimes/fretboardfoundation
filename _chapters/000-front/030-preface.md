## Why this book

This book exists to fill a gap I find in guitar instructional material. 

Countless resources are available for beginners, 
and there are excellent materials for advanced musicians with a solid background in theory and practice.
But for those in-between, the “intermediate” guitarists, 
it can be a long, hard slog to master the instrument well enough to be able to really express ourselves. 

Most of the material aimed at this level sorts into either classical or jazz styles. 
Classical guitar instruction tends to focus on the precise reproduction of a composer's intent, 
with little emphasis on improvisation or creativity. 
Jazz digs deep into improvisation and theory, 
but with techniques that often don’t translate well to other styles because of an emphasis on dissonance and extended chords. 
And both approaches promise *at best* a long and winding road toward mastery, 
requiring years of study and a somewhat blind faith that it will lead where we want to go. 

The approach taken in this book is different.
It's based on an idea of "triage",
doing the most important things first to make the best of limited time or resources.
In the long run, it would be ideal to learn everything. 
But for *right now*, given the overwhelming amount there is to learn, 
how can we make the most progress in the shortest time? 
What’s the minimum information needed, and what’s the fastest way to learn it?

Obviously the answer depends in part on where we want to go.
But there is a common foundation that is often required.
This book aims to provide that foundation in a practical way. 

## Who this book is for

If you are among the imagined audience for this book, 
you might describe yourself as an intermediate guitarist. 
You can play some songs, and you know whatever you consider to be “the basics”. 
You can play chords, and maybe some scales (or maybe not). 
The subjects in this book sound at least vaguely familiar to you.

Most importantly, you want to make music on guitar, 
with a facility and a graceful freedom that allows you to express yourself creatively,
and produce the sounds you hear inside as directly and purely as possible. 

If this describes you, welcome.
I'm glad you're here.
Please read on.
