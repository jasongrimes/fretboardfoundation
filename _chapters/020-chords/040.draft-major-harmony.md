Major key harmony starts with the major scale.
The following diagram shows the major scale on the upper strings,
with the tonic on the first string (and also the fourth string).
(See {% include chapter-link.html slug="major-scale" %}
for details.)

As described in {% include chapter-link.html slug="harmony-intro" %},
we find the chords in a major key by harmonizing the major scale.
There are seven chords in the key,
corresponding to the seven degrees of the scale.
These chords, which include only the notes found in the parent scale,
are called "diatonic" chords.
Diatonic chords are numbered with roman numerals,
so the "I" chord has its root on the 1&#x302; scale degree, 
the "V" chord has its root on the 5&#x302; scale degree, 
and so on.

We build the **I chord** by starting on scale degree 1&#x302; and "stacking thirds" ---
adding every other note (i.e. every alternate note, like 1-3-5 or 2-4-6)  until we have enough notes in the chord.
So we construct the I chord with the 1&#x302;, 3&#x302;, and 5&#x302; scale degrees.

{% include figure.html 
    caption="I chord, major key 1st-string tonic." 
    url="/assets/figures/major-key-treble-triads/1-I-wide.svg" 
    class="chord" 
%}

Notes in a chord are labeled based on the generic interval from the root.
These labeled chord notes are called "factors".
A triad chord has a "root", "third", and "fifth" factor.

A **major chord** has a **major third** (a major-third interval between its root and its third factor).
A **minor chord** has a **minor-third**.

In the I chord, the "root" corresponds to the 1&#x302; of the scale,
the "third" corresponds to the 3&#x302; of the scale,
and the "fifth" corresponds to the 5&#x302; of the scale.
In a major key,
the I chord is a major chord,
because it has a major third.

The diminished triad vii chord doesn’t get much love, 
with most people dismissing it as “rarely used” or “not practical”. 
But notice that it contains almost exactly the same notes as the dominant V7 chord, 
which is one of the most important chords in euroclassical harmony. 
This rootless V7 chord is often exactly the right sound to drive a chord progression home. 
It’s easy to play, 
and easy to add a bass note of either the 5 (for a true V7 chord) or the 7 (for a richer diminished triad) as desired. 
“Not practical”, eh?
