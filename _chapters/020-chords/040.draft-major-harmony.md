The diminished triad vii chord doesn’t get much love, 
with most people dismissing it as “rarely used” or “not practical”. 
But notice that it contains almost exactly the same notes as the dominant V7 chord, 
which is one of the most important chords in euroclassical harmony. 
This rootless V7 chord is often exactly the right sound to drive a chord progression home. 
It’s easy to play, 
and easy to add a bass note of either the 5 (for a true V7 chord) or the 7 (for a richer diminished triad) as desired. 
“Not practical”, eh?
