The vast majority of songs in Western music are written in a major key.

Songs in a major key use notes and chords from the major scale,
with a special emphasis on the first scale degree,
the "tonic" or "key center" (the note the key is named for).
Major key songs treat the tonic as a home and a point of rest,
and typically use the tonic note more frequently than any other note in the scale.

## Chords in a major key

As described in {% include chapter-link.html slug="harmony-intro" %},
the chords in a major key are determined by harmonizing the major scale.

## Chord shapes in one position

Here is the major scale on the treble strings,
with the tonic on the first string.
(See {% include chapter-link.html slug="major-scale" %} for details.)

The following diagrams show the diatonic chords in a major key as treble triads,
arranged around the first-string tonic.
(Note that the two lowest strings have been left out of the diagrams in order to save space.)

## Primary and secondary chords

Primary chords: I IV V

Secondary chords: vi ii iii

## The vii&deg; and the V7

The diminished triad vii chord doesn’t get much love, 
with most people dismissing it as “rarely used” or “not practical”. 
But notice that it contains almost exactly the same notes as the dominant V7 chord, 
which is one of the most important chords in euroclassical harmony. 

| Chord        | Scale degrees | Chord factors | Chord type |
|:------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| **V7**       | 5 7 2 4       | R 3 5 b7      | dominant 7 |
| **vii&deg;** | 7 2 4         | R b3 b5       | diminished |

In major key harmony,
the V chord is often played as a "dominant seventh chord"
(sometimes referred to as simply a "seventh chord").
A dominant seventh chord is a major triad with an added minor seventh interval.
It is notated by simply adding a "7" to the chord symbol,
like "G7" or "V7". 
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="seventh-chords" %} for more information.

The V7 chord is constructed by simply stacking another third onto the V triad,
as shown in the table above.
The V is the only dominant 7 chord that occurs when harmonizing a major key.

Playing the V as a dominant seventh adds even more tension to the dominant function of this chord,
making it pull even more urgently toward the I,
according to functional harmony.
This V7-I progression is very common in Western music (including popular music).

The vii&deg; has nearly the same effect.
This rootless V7 chord is often exactly the right sound to drive a chord progression home. 
It’s easy to play, 
and easy to add a bass note of either the 5 (for a true V7 chord) or the 7 (for a richer diminished triad) as desired. 
“Not practical”, indeed.
