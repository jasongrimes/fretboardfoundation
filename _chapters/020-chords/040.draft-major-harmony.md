Major key harmony starts with the major scale.
The following diagram shows the major scale on the treble strings,
with the tonic on the first string.
(See {% include chapter-link.html slug="major-scale" %} for details.)

As described in {% include chapter-link.html slug="harmony-intro" %},
we find the chords in a major key by harmonizing the major scale.
There are seven chords in the key,
corresponding to the seven degrees of the scale.
These seven chords native to the key are called "diatonic" chords.
Diatonic chords are numbered with roman numerals,
so the "I" chord has its root on the 1&#x302; scale degree, 
the "V" chord has its root on the 5&#x302; scale degree, 
and so on.
Uppercase roman numerals are used to represent major chords,
and lowercase roman numerals represent minor chords.

When harmonizing a scale,
different types of chords will be created,
depending on the intervals between the notes of the chords.
The notes of a chord are called factors,
and they are named according to their generic interval from the chord root.
A triad chord has three factors: the "root", "third", and "fifth".
If the third factor of a chord is a major-third interval from the root
(or put more succinctly, if the chord "has a major third"),
it's a major chord.
If a chord has a minor third,
it's a minor chord.


We build the **I chord** by starting on scale degree 1&#x302; and "stacking thirds"---
adding every alternate note until we have enough notes in the chord.
So we construct the I triad chord with the 1&#x302;, 3&#x302;, and 5&#x302; scale degrees.
In the I chord, therefore, 
the "root" corresponds to the 1&#x302; of the scale,
the "third" corresponds to the 3&#x302; of the scale,
and the "fifth" corresponds to the 5&#x302; of the scale.

The figure on the left below shows the I chord harmonized from the major scale,
as described above.
The figure on the right shows the first-string root major triad shape from

    class="chord row"

As we can see,
in a major key the I chord is a major chord,
because it has a major third.

The <strong>ii chord</strong> is built in the same way.
Start on scale degree 2&#x302; and stack thirds.
The root of the ii chord will be on scale degree 2&#x302;,
the third will be on 4&#x302;, 
and the fifth will be on 6&#x302;.
This time, the result is a minor chord,
because the third factor of the ii chord is a minor third.
(There's a minor-third interval between degrees 2&#x302; and 4&#x302; of the major scale
the root and third factors of the ii chord.)
This is why the ii chord in a major key is represented as a lowercase roman numeral.

The remaining diatonic chords are harmonized in the same way,
as shown in the figures below. 
(Note that the two lowest strings have been left out of the diagrams in order to save space.)

The diminished triad vii chord doesn’t get much love, 
with most people dismissing it as “rarely used” or “not practical”. 
But notice that it contains almost exactly the same notes as the dominant V7 chord, 
which is one of the most important chords in euroclassical harmony. 
This rootless V7 chord is often exactly the right sound to drive a chord progression home. 
It’s easy to play, 
and easy to add a bass note of either the 5 (for a true V7 chord) or the 7 (for a richer diminished triad) as desired. 
“Not practical”, indeed.
