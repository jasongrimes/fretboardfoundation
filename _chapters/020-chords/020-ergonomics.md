Before practicing  chord shapes,
it's important to know some basic ergonomic principles so that we don't develop habits that lead to pain or difficulty over time. 

The basic ergonomic rule is this:

> **If something hurts, stop doing it right away.**
> 
> Do something else that doesn't hurt instead.

Some tips:

- Keep fretting fingers *and thumb* curled as though holding a softball.
This prevents undue leverage from being applied to basal joints,
which can eventually lead to pain.
It also keeps fingers nimble and ready to move. 

- Keep the fretting wrist at a neutral angle, 
to prevent tendons from rubbing. 
Make this easier by adjusting the elbow in and out from the body,
and tilting the guitar neck upward. 
A strap with a suede backing can help hold the guitar tilted in a comfortable fretting position. 

- Barre chords should not hurt.
Seriously.
It can be hard to play barre chords in a way that doesn't hurt,
so it may not be worth the effort.
There are alternative grips for any barre chords that may be more comfortable.
Or play the barre only at the tip and base of the first finger,
don't presss down on the middle strings at all.
Whatever the approach,
it absolutely must not hurt.

Christopher Bergâ€™s excellent 
*Mastering Guitar Technique: Process and Essence* 
[(Berg, 1997)](references#berg-1997) 
has a great deal more about optimal positioning of the body for playing guitar.
