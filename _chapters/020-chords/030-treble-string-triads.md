Guitar strings are numbered 1-6, 
with string 1 the highest pitched (high E) and 6 the lowest (low E). 
The “treble strings” generally refer to the top three strings (1-3).

Minimal, moveable, 3-note triad chord shapes are found on each group of three consecutive strings (1-3, 2-4, 3-5, and 4-6). 

It’s particularly useful to know the following 3-note triads. 
They sound good in a lot of contexts. 
They are easy to play and can be played quickly. 
It’s straightforward to embellish them with bass notes or color tones when desired. 
There’s at least one chord with a root note on each treble string (which is where melodies are typically played), 
so it’s easy to sprinkle them into melody lines. 
And they provide a simple basis for the study and practice of harmony.

In addition to the triads on the top 3 strings, 
a few alternate choices on the upper-middle strings (2-4) are included, 
because in some cases they are more convenient to play. 

Chord shapes for major, minor, and diminished triads are presented. 
These are the basis for our study of harmony because they are the three types of chords found when harmonizing the major scale.
