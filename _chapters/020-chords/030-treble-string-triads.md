abstract: Lightweight movable chord shapes on the upper strings.

Guitar strings are numbered 1-6, 
with the highest-pitched (high E) as string 1,
and the lowest-pitched (low E) as string 6. 
The “treble strings” are the three highest-pitched strings,
and the "bass strings" are the three lowest-pitched strings.

Movable, three-note triad chord shapes are found on each group of three consecutive strings:
the top-three (1-3),
upper-middle (2-4),
lower-middle (3-5),
and bottom-three (4-6) strings. 

It’s particularly useful to know the "treble triads" presented in this chapter.
They sound good in a lot of contexts; 
they are easy to play and can be played quickly. 
It’s straightforward to embellish them with bass notes or color tones when desired. 
It’s easy to sprinkle them into melody lines,
because there’s at least one chord shape with a root note on each treble string (which is where melodies are typically played).
And they provide a simple starting place for the study and practice of harmony.

The list below includes the triads on the top-three strings.
It also includes a few alternate choices on the upper-middle strings, 
because in some cases those are more convenient to play.
Shapes are presented for major, minor, and diminished triads, 
which are the basis for our study of harmony
because they're the three types of chords found when harmonizing the major scale. 
The dots in the diagrams indicate the chord root note (R) and the intervals from the root. 

When playing these chords, 
you'll need to mute the unused strings with a neighboring finger.
That tends to be pretty natural to do with these shapes.

If it's not obvious,
the root note determines the name of the chord.
For example, to play a C major triad,
pick one of the major chord shapes and put the root note on C on the fretboard.
To play C minor,
use a minor chord shape with the root on C,
and so on.

### On the whole fretboard

One way to practice is to pick a chord,
like A minor,
and play it in multiple places on the fretboard with different voicings 
(i.e. with the root on different strings).

Notice where the different shapes are in relation to each other:
the voicings move up the neck in order,
with a 1st-string root shape followed by a 2nd-string root shape,
followed by a 3rd-string root shape, followed by a 1st-string root shape, etc.
Also notice the different sounds of the different voicings for the same chord.
