Guitar strings are numbered 1-6, 
with the highest-pitched (high E) as string 1,
and the lowest-pitched (low E) as string 6. 
The “treble strings” are the three highest-pitched strings,
and the "bass strings" are the three lowest-pitched strings.

Moveable, three-note triad chords are found on each group of three consecutive strings:
the top-three (1-3),
upper-middle (2-4),
lower-middle (3-5),
and bottom-three (4-6). 

It’s particularly useful to know the following three-note triad chord shapes.
They sound good in a lot of contexts, 
they are easy to play and can be played quickly. 
It’s straightforward to embellish them with bass notes or color tones when desired. 
It’s easy to sprinkle them into melody lines,
because there’s at least one chord shape with a root note on each treble string (which is where melodies are typically played).
And they provide a simple basis for the study and practice of harmony.

In addition to the triads on the top-three strings, 
a few alternate choices on the upper-middle strings (2-4) are included, 
because in some cases they are more convenient to play. 

Chord shapes for major, minor, and diminished triads are presented. 
These are the basis for our study of harmony because they're the three types of chords found when harmonizing the major scale.

### Playing these chords

When playing these chords, 
you'll need to mute the unused strings with a neighboring finger.
That tends to be pretty natural to do with these shapes.

To play a C major triad,
pick one of the major chord shapes,
and put the root note on C on the fretboard.
To play C minor,
use a minor chord shape,
and so on.

One way to practice is to pick a chord,
like A minor,
and play it in multiple different places on the fretboard with different voicings 
(i.e. with the root on different strings).
Notice where the different shapes are in relation to each other:
for example, a 2nd-string root shape has a 1st-string root voicing immediately below it,
and a 3rd-string root voicing immediately above it.
Also notice the different sounds of the different voicings for the same chord.

If you need help locating the note names on the fretboard,
see the chapter on [Note names and registers](note-names).
