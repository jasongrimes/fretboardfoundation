## About treble triads

Treble triads are minimal,
movable triad chord shapes on the treble strings that are particularly useful to know.

They sound good in a lot of contexts.
They are easy to play and can be played quickly. 
They can be embellished with bass notes or color tones,
or sprinkled into melody lines.
And they provide a simple starting place for the study of harmony.

Treble triads distill the core triad shapes out of all the possible CAGED shapes,
reducing the number of shapes to learn.
In other words, 
it would take almost twice as long to learn harmony with the 5 CAGED shapes as with 3 triad shapes.
The triads can be decorated with the remaining CAGED notes as needed.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="caged" %} for details. 


Major, minor, and diminished shapes are given, 
because they're the chords found when harmonizing the major scale.

Dots in the diagrams indicate the chord root note (R) and the intervals from the root. 
The root note determines the name of the chord.

When playing these chords, 
you'll need to mute the unused strings with a neighboring finger.
That tends to be pretty natural to do with these shapes.

## Practicing these chord shapes

One way to practice is to pick a chord,
like A minor,
and play it in multiple places on the fretboard.

Notice where the different shapes are in relation to each other:
the voicings move up the neck in order,
with a 1st-string root shape followed by a 2nd-string root shape,
followed by a 3rd-string root shape, followed by a 1st-string root shape, etc.
Also notice the different sounds of the different voicings for the same chord.

## More about triads

The chords presented in this chapter are called treble-string triads because they have root notes on each of the three treble strings.

The treble strings are the three highest-pitched strings on a guitar;
the three lowest-pitched are the "bass strings". 
Guitar strings are numbered 1-6, 
with the highest-pitched as string 1,
and the lowest-pitched as string 6.
So the treble strings are strings 1-3.

Movable, three-note triad chord shapes are found on each group of three consecutive strings:
the top-three (1-3),
upper-middle (2-4),
lower-middle (3-5),
and bottom-three (4-6) strings. 

This chapter focused on the triads on the top-three strings,
plus a few alternate choices on the upper-middle strings
because in some cases those are more convenient to play.
Triads on the other strings are worth exploring as well.

_Three-Note Voicings and Beyond_, by Randy Vincent [(Vincent, 2011)](references#vincent-2011), 
is an excellent source of information about triad voicings (and much more).
