## What is a minor key

## Chords in natural minor

Most of the chords in a minor key are determined by harmonizing the natural minor scale.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="harmony-intro" %} for details.

Notice that in a minor key:
- the **i**, **iv**, and **v** diatonic chords are **minor**,
- the **bIII**, **bVI**, and **bVI** chords are **major**, and
- the **ii** chord is a **diminished** triad.

## Relative major and minor

The notes in a natural minor scale are identical to the notes in the relative major scale a minor third above it.
For example,
the notes and chords in A natural minor are the same as in C major.

Though the keys of C major and A minor have the same chords and the same notes,
the two keys feel different. 
The chords in the different keys have a different meaning,
a different keycenter,
different scale degrees,
and different harmonic functions.

## Leading tone and harmonic minor

The natural minor scale does not have a leading tone.
Degree 7&#x302; is a minor seventh,
not a major seventh.

But euroclassical composers used the leading tone in minor key songs anyway,
and called it "harmonic minor".
The irresistible pull of the leading tone into the tonic is a seductive harmonic device,
and it can sound particularly poignant in a minor key.

Adding the leading tone creates some new chords that can be used in cadences: **V(7) and #vii&deg;**.

| Chord        | In Am       | Scale degrees | In Am    | Chord factors | Chord type |
|:------------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:--------:|:--------------|:----------:|
| **v**        | **Em**      | 5-b7-2        | E-G-B    | R b3 5        | minor      |
| **V**        | **E**       | 5-7-2         | E-G#-B   | R 3 5         | major      |
| **V7**       | **E7**      | 5-7-2-4       | E-G#-B-D | R 3 5 b7      | dominant 7 |
| **bVII**     | **G**       | b7-2-4        | G-B-D    | R 3 5         | major      |
| **vii&deg;** | **G#&deg;** | 7-2-4         | G#-B-D   | R b3 b5       | diminished |

</div>

Raising the b7&#x302; degree of the scale changes the v chord from minor to major V (or V7),
and changes the bVII chord from major to diminished vii&deg;.
These are the same dominant and diminished degrees as in a major key,
enabling all the same cadences and tricks of harmonic function as in a major key.

It is common to mix both major seventh and minor seventh degrees freely in the same minor key composition.
The chord v and and V7 might be used in the same song,
and the bIII is usually played as a major triad and rarely augmented with the major 7&#x302;.

Additionally,
euroclassical composers preferred to avoid melodic leaps around the leading tone,
and so adjusted the intervals of the sixth and seventh scale degrees in melodic lines according to taste.
These contortions are collectively called "melodic minor".
