## What is a minor key

## Chords in natural minor

## Relative major and minor

## Harmonic minor with the leading tone

## Shapes in first-string tonic position

Notice that the notes are identical between the natural minor and the relative major scale with a different tonic.
It's a quick way to learn the chords in a minor key: 
learn a major key and you get the relative minor for free.

For example, the keys of C major and A minor have the same chords and the same notes,
but with a different meaning,
a different keycenter,
different scale degrees and different harmonic functions.

Compare these diatonic minor chords with their relative [diatonic major chords around a 3rd-string tonic](major-harmony#shapes-around-a-third-string-tonic).
