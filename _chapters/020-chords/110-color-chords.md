## About color chords

To increase tension,
add "color" and express a range of emotion,
diatonic chords of Western harmony can be enriched by adding one or more tones from outside the chord.

This leads to a bewildering variety of guitar chords that can seem endless,
disorganized, and confusing.
And there really are quite a lot of wonderful chord voicings and grips to be explored.

But all of these chords can be organized into a few families,
and clarified by understanding a few conventions of chord naming and construction.

### Chord families

Color chords can be grouped into three main families: major, minor, and dominant.

- **major** chords have a **major third** and a **major seventh**.
- **minor** chords have a **minor third** and a **minor seventh**.
- **dominant** chords have a **major third** and a **minor seventh**.

Suspended chords are neither major nor minor,
so they fit into both families.

Color chords can be used in a progression to replace any chord from the same family (ex. C major could be replaced by C6 or Cadd9, C7 could be replaced by C13 or C7#9, etc.).

### Understanding chord names

Chord names follow a basic convention.

- **"add"**: a non-chord tone added to a major or minor chord. Ex. Cadd9
- **6**: Shorthand for "add6". Ex. C6 or Cm6 (aka "Cadd6" and "Cm add6")
- **7,9,11,13**: A chord name with just a number implies a dominant chord (having a M3 and a b7). Ex. C7, C13
- **#/b 5,9,11,13**: A dominant seventh chord with the given tones altered as specified.

### Compound intervals

Chord intervals bigger than 7 indicate compound intervals, an octave above the simple interval.
To focus on how the chord tones fit into the overall harmony rather than on what they are called,
it can be helpful to think of them in terms of their simple intervals, ex. "2" rather than "9".

- **9** is an octave above **2**
- **11** is an octave above **4**
- **13** is an octave above **6**

### Chords in this chapter

This chapter does not include a comprehensive list of chords and voicings.

Rather,
it's a curated list aiming to include the most common chord grips for some of the most common chords.
