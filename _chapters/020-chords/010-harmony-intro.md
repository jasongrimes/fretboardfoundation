## Emotion and story

- Tension and release
- expectation and surprise
- hero's journey (hero goes on an adventure, is victorious in a decisive crisis, and comes home transformed)

## Intervals: the building blocks

- Intervals are the distance between notes
- Can express and evoke emotion
- Naming: Number and quality
- Major intervals are the same as the major scale degrees

## Tonical (aka tonal) harmony

- Music with a key center
- Euroclassical origin. 
- Common, but there are other kinds.
- Tonic vs leading tone. Tension and release. 

## Triad chords

- Tertian harmony (stacking thirds). Common, but there are other kinds.
- chord factors
- Triad chord types and formulas (maj/min/dim/aug)

## Harmonizing a scale

- Building chords from scale degrees
- Roman numeral numbering

## Harmonic function

- The theoretical tendency of certain chords to "want" to progress to other chords, or remain at rest. 
- Euroclassical origin. Less used in modern and non-Western music, but still useful to understand.
- harmonic functions (tonic, subdominant or pre-dominant, dominant)
- V-I cadence and ii-V-I progression
- chord families 
  - tonic: I and vi (some also include iii, I disagree)
  - subdominant: IV and ii
  - dominant: V and vii (sometimes iii or III)
