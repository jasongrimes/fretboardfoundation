## Emotion and story

- Tension and release
- expectation and surprise
- hero's journey (hero goes on an adventure, is victorious in a decisive crisis, and comes home transformed)

## Intervals: the building blocks

Intervals are the distance between notes.
More specifically, 
intervals describe the difference in pitch between two tones
(See {% include chapter-link.html slug="glossary" anchor="interval"%}.)

In euroclassical music theory,
and therefore in most Western music,
the smallest interval is a "semitone".
A semitone is the difference in pitch between two notes on a guitar string on either side of the same fret.
Intervals smaller than a semitone are also possible;
these are called "microtones" and are common in Blues and non-Western musical traditions.
The guitar is one of the few Western instruments capable of producing microtones (by bending strings).




- Intervals are the distance between notes
- Can express and evoke emotion
- Naming: Number and quality
- Major intervals are the same as the major scale degrees

## Chords

A chord is a group of two or more notes sounded together.

Chords are constructed by "stacking thirds" 
(in "tertian harmony" that is, which is the most common type of harmony in the Western world.
Other types of harmony exist,
like "quartal",
which is based on stacking fourths.)

Stacking thirds refers to adding successive intervals of a third until the chord has as many notes as we want it to.
Another way to think of stacking thirds is adding *every other* note in a scale. 

## Triad chords

A "triad chord" is a three-note chord built by stacking thirds.
Triads are the most common chords in Western music.

The components of a chord are sometimes called "factors".
The lowest factor in a chord is called the "root".
The next factor is called the "third",
which is a major-third or a minor-third interval above the root.
The last factor in a triad is called the "fifth",
which is a major- or minor-third interval above the "third",
and either a perfect fifth (most commonly)
or else an augmented or diminished fifth above the root.

There are four types or "qualities" of triad,
based on the qualities of its factor intervals.

| Triad quality  | Third interval        | Fifth interval (above third) above root |
| **major**      | M3                    | (m3) P5 |
| **minor**      | m3                    | (M3) P5 |
| **augmented**  | M3                    | (M3) #5 |
| **diminished** | m3                    | (m3) b5 |

## Tonical (aka tonal) harmony

- Music with a key center
- Euroclassical origin. 
- Common, but there are other kinds.
- Tonic vs leading tone. Tension and release. 

## Harmonizing a scale

- Building chords from scale degrees
- Roman numeral numbering

## Harmonic function

- The theoretical tendency of certain chords to "want" to progress to other chords, or remain at rest. 
- Euroclassical origin. Less used in modern and non-Western music, but still useful to understand.
- harmonic functions (tonic, subdominant/pre-dominant, dominant)
- V-I cadence and ii-V-I progression
- chord families 
  - tonic: I and vi (some also include iii, I disagree)
  - subdominant: IV and ii
  - dominant: V and vii (sometimes iii or III)
