## Emotion and story

Music is a form of communication.
It’s used to express ideas and emotions,
and to evoke the same in others.

Western harmony,
which derives from the European classical music (“euroclassical”) tradition,
provides tools to do this,
based on tension and release,
consonance and dissonance,
and shared cultural experience.

### Tension and release

"Tension and release" is a basic biological mechanism,
shared perhaps by all life. 

It is the basis of locomotion---it physically moves us---and
it moves us emotionally as well.

### Consonance and dissonance

Tension and release are created with "consonant" and "dissonant" sounds.

Consonant sounds are mathematically simple and harmonically relaxed. 

Dissonant sounds are mathematically complex and harmonically tense.

### Expectation and surprise

Tension and release can also be created by playing with listeners' expectations.

All the music we have previously heard creates expectations about music we will hear in the future.

If we have a similar enough background to the listener to know what their expectations are,
we can play with those expectations to provoke a response. 

For example,
we can choose to give them something they expect,
provoking familiarity;
give them something they didn't expect but are also familiar with,
provoking surprise and hopefully delight;
delay meeting their expectations, provoking tension;
and so on. 

### The hero's journey

"Harmonic functions" can be used to tell a kind of story,
similar in some ways to the "hero's journey" narrative pattern
which is common in myths and stories across many cultures.

In both the hero's journey and in harmonic progressions,
the hero goes on an adventure, 
is victorious in a decisive crisis, 
and comes home transformed.

## Intervals: the building blocks

Intervals are the basic building blocks of harmony.
They are responsible for the way music sounds and how it makes us feel. 

### Pitch and frequency

An interval describes the difference in pitch between two tones.
The larger the interval,
the greater the difference in pitch.

Pitch is the frequency at which a sound wave vibrates.
The higher the frequency,
the faster the vibration,
and the higher the pitch sounds to our ears.

### Interval names

Intervals have names like "major third",
comprised of two parts: "quality" (major) and "number" (third).

#### Interval numbers

The number or numeric size of an interval is the number of letter names from one note to the next in the musical alphabet.

For example, the interval from a C to a D is a second,
from C to E is a third,
and from C to G is a fifth.
The interval from C to A is a sixth,
because the musical alphabet goes to G and then wraps around to A again. 

The interval from C to the next C above or below is called an "octave" (meaning 8),
and from a note to itself is called a "unison" (meaning 1).

#### Perfect intervals

The qualities of fourth, fifth, octave, and unison intervals are called "perfect",
because the sound waves of the pitches separated by those intervals vibrate together in an overlapping and mathematically elegant way.
This makes them sound highly consonant. 

#### Major, minor, augmented, and diminished intervals

The quality of the remaining non-perfect intervals are called either "major" or "minor",
which is determined by how many "semitones" they contain.

Perfect intervals can also be raised or lowered by a semitone,
changing their quality from perfect to "augmented" or "diminished".

#### Semitones and tones

A "semitone" is the smallest interval in most Western music.
It's the difference between two notes on a guitar string on either side of one fret.
Semitones are also called "half steps".

In Western music,
there are twelve semitones in an octave.

The term "tone", 
when used as an interval name,
means two semitones,
a distance of two frets.
Sometimes the terms "whole tone" or "whole step" are used instead. 

Be aware that the term "tone" has other meanings as well,
such as "any note with a discernible pitch".
See ["tone" in the glossary](glossary#tone) for details. 

### Interval table

This table shows the names of intervals based on how many semitones they contain.
The number of semitones can also be thought of as the number of frets the interval spans on one string.

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| Semi-tones/ frets | Interval   | Note from C | Short scale degree name | Scale degree name | Frequency ratio/ dissonance |
|:--:|:-------------------|:------:|:------:|:----------------------|:-----:|
| 0  | unison (P1)        | C      | 1      | tonic, one            | 1:1   |

| 10 | minor seventh (m7) | A#/ Bb | b7     | flat seven            | 9:5   |
| 11 | major seventh (M7) | B      | 7      | major seven, sharp seven, leading tone | 15:8 |
| 12 | octave (P8)        | C      | 8      | tonic, eight          | 2:1   |

</div>

The table includes the corresponding note of a C chromatic scale for reference,
and the short and long names commonly used for those scale degrees.

It also includes the frequency ratio to the tonic,
which suggests how consonant or dissonant the interval will sound
(bigger numbers are more complex and therefore more dissonant).


## Chords

Western harmony is expressed through chords.

A chord is a group of two or more notes sounded together.

### Stacking thirds

In most Western music, 
chords are constructed by "stacking thirds".

Stacking thirds refers to adding successive intervals of a third until the chord has as many notes as we want it to.
Another way to think of stacking thirds is adding *every other* note in a scale. 

Building chords from stacked thirds is called "tertian harmony",
which is the most common type of harmony in Western music.
(There are others, like "quartal harmony", which is based on stacking fourths.)

### Triad chords

A "triad chord" is a three-note chord built by stacking thirds. 
Triads are the most common chords in Western music.

The three notes in a triad chord are called the "root",
the "third", 
and the "fifth" factors of the chord. 
The third factor is a major- or minor-third interval above the root. 
The fifth factor is a perfect fifth (usually) or else a diminished or augmented fifth above the root.
The fifth factor is also a major- or minor-third interval above the third
(which makes sense since the chord is built by stacking thirds).

There are four types of triad chord.
The chord type is determined by the intervals between its factors and the root.

| Chord type     | Intervals | Notes (on C) | Symbol (on C)         |
|----------------|-----------|:------------:|-----------------------|

| **augmented**  | R 3 #5    | C-E-G#       | Caug, C+              |

</div>


### Harmonizing a scale

Harmonizing a scale refers to assembling the chords that belong to a given key, scale, or mode,
by starting on each degree of the scale and stacking thirds to form a triad chord.
The result is one chord for each degree in the scale.

The chords will be of different types depending on how the scale degree intervals fall within the chord.

Chords are numbered with Roman numerals matching the number of their scale degree.
Uppercase Roman numerals are used for major chords,
and lowercase Roman numerals are used for minor chords.

#### Harmonizing the major scale

For example,
the **major scale** has degrees 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 (in C: C-D-E-F-G-A-B).

Harmonizing the major scale gives the following chords:

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| Chord        | In C       | Scale degrees | In C  | Chord factors | Chord type |
|:------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|:-----:|:--------------|:----------:|
| **I**        | **C**      | 1-3-5         | C-E-G | R 3 5         | major      |
| **ii**       | **Dm**     | 2-4-6         | D-F-A | R b3 5        | minor      |
| **iii**      | **Em**     | 3-5-7         | E-G-B | R b3 5        | minor      |
| **IV**       | **F**      | 4-6-1         | F-A-C | R 3 5         | major      |
| **V**        | **G**      | 5-7-2         | G-B-D | R 3 5         | major      |
| **vi**       | **Am**     | 6-1-3         | A-C-E | R b3 5        | minor      |
| **vii&deg;** | **B&deg;** | 7-2-4         | B-D-F | R b3 b5       | diminished |

</div>

The type of each chord is determined by the intervals of its chord factors.

#### Finding the intervals between factors

The intervals of the chord factors can be determined by counting the number of semitones between the factors and the root.

To find the chord factor intervals using the [interval table](#interval-table),
look up the number of semitones in the factor's scale degree,
and subtract the number of semitones in the root scale degree.
If the number is negative,
add 12 semitones 
(because the chord spans the end of the scale into the next octave).
The resulting difference is the number of semitones in the interval,
which can then be looked up from the table.

For example, the V chord has scale degrees 5&#x302;-7&#x302;-2&#x302;.
(Scale degree numbers are sometimes written with "hats" (5&#x302;) when it adds clarity,
to distinguish them from other numbers.)
The chord's root is degree 5&#x302;,
which is 7 semitones from the tonic.
The chord's third factor is degree 7&#x302;,
which is 11 semitones from the tonic.
The interval between the root and third factors is 11-7=4 semitones,
which is a major third.
So the chord's third factor is a major third.

The V chord's fifth factor is degree 2&#x302;,
which is 2 semitones from the tonic.
The interval between the root and fifth factors is 2-7=-5 semitones,
which is a negative number because the chord spans the end of the scale into the next octave.
Adding 12 semitones to account for the octave, -5+12=7 semitones,
which is a perfect fifth.

So the V chord's factor intervals are R 3 5 (root, major third, perfect fifth),
which makes it a major chord,
represented by an uppercase Roman numeral (V and not v). 

#### Harmony without math

This all sounds a lot more complicated than it usually is in practice.

For one thing,
we normally just memorize the harmonized chord types.
It's pretty easy to remember that in a major key the I, IV, and V are major,
the ii, iii, and vi are minor,
and the vii is diminished.

It's also usually much easier to find intervals directly on the fretboard,
rather than doing the math with the interval table.
See the section on [finding intervals on the fretboard with the major scale](#finding-intervals-on-the-fretboard-with-the-major-scale) 
later in this chapter.

#### Harmonizing the natural minor scale

As another example,
the **natural minor** scale has degrees 1-2-b3-4-5-b6-b7 (in C: C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb).

Harmonizing the natural minor scale gives the following chords:

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| Chord        | In C       | Scale degrees | In C     | Chord factors | Chord type |
|:------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|:--------:|:--------------|:----------:|
| **i**        | **Cm**     | 1-b3-5        | C-Eb-G   | R b3 5        | minor      |
| **ii&deg;**  | **D&deg;** | 2-4-b6        | D-Fb-Ab  | R b3 b5       | diminished |
| **III**      | **Eb**     | b3-5-b7       | Eb-G-Bb  | R b3 5        | major      |
| **iv**       | **Fm**     | 4-b6-1        | F-Ab-C   | R b3 5        | minor      |
| **v**        | **Gm**     | 5-b7-2        | G-Bb-D   | R b3 5        | minor      |
| **VI**       | **Ab**     | b6-1-b3       | Ab-C-Eb  | R 3 5         | major      |
| **VII**      | **Bb**     | b7-2-4        | Bb-D-F   | R 3 5         | major      |

</div>

Note that minor *key* harmony is slightly more complicated than just harmonizing the natural minor scale.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="minor-harmony" %} for details.

## Harmonic function

"Harmonic function" describes the theoretical tendency of certain chords to "want" to progress to other chords,
or remain at rest.

This approach originated in euroclassical music of the 18th and 19th centuries,
and still heavily influences jazz music.
It is less apparent in modern and non-Western music,
but it can still be useful to understand.

### Euroclassical scale degree names

Harmonic function terminology is based on the names given to the scale degrees in the euroclassical tradition.

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| Degree | Name         | Description |
|:------:|:-------------|:------------|
| 1      | Tonic        | Tonal center, key center, note of final resolution. |
| 2      | Supertonic   | The degree above (super) the tonic. |
| 3      | Mediant      | Midway (medi) between the tonic and dominant |
| 4      | Subdominant  | Lower (sub) dominant. A perfect fifth *below* the tonic. |
| 5      | Dominant     | A perfect fifth above the tonic. The fifth is the dominant harmonic (i.e. the most common) in the [overtone series](glossary#overtone-series). |
| 6      | Submediant   | Lower (sub) mediant, midway (medi) between the tonic and the subdominant. |
| b7     | Subtonic     | The note below (sub) the tonic when it's a whole tone below, as in the natural minor scale. |
| 7      | Leading tone | The note a semitone below the tonic, as in the major scale. It leads to the tonic. |

</div>

### The leading tone

The leading tone is the note of a scale that is one semitone below the tonic.

The minor second interval between the leading tone and the tonic is very dissonant.
Most listeners will find it tense and wish for it to resolve somewhere more consonant.

Western listeners tend to expect the 7 to be followed by the 1, based on past experience.
If in most music we have heard in the past, C-D-E-F-G-A-B... has almost always been followed by another C,
we will expect this because it's what always happens.
(If that has not been our experience, expectations might be different.)

This combination of tension and expectation results in "wanting" the dissonant leading tone to resolve to the consonant tonic.

### Tonic, subdominant, and dominant functions

Chords can be grouped into three basic harmonic functions.

* **Tonic**: Home, a place of stability
* **Subdominant**: Away from home, but still stable.
* **Dominant**: A place of tension, pulling toward home.

Typically a harmonic sequence will start at home (a tonic),
move away from it (to a subdominant),
then to a place of tension (a dominant),
before providing emotional release or resolution by returning home (to the tonic).

This progression mirrors a classic storytelling arc.
Compare it to the "hero's journey" narrative pattern:
1. The hero goes on an adventure (subdominant), 
2. is victorious in a decisive crisis (dominant), and 
3. comes home transformed (tonic).

In a major key,
the diatonic chords are typically given these functions:
* **Tonic**: I, vi, iii
* **Subdominant**: IV, ii
* **Dominant**: V, vii

One way to understand this is by comparing the intervals of the chords to the tonic.

The harmonic functions are named after the root scale degree of the I, IV, and V chords.
These are the "primary chords",
and serve as archetypes of the chord functions.

* Tonic I (1-3-5) is home.
* Dominant V (5-7-2) is away from home,
  sharing only one note in common with the I.
  It is also dissonant,
  because it has the leading tone (7&#x302;).
  Consequently we "want" it to resolve to the 1&#x302; (the root of the tonic).
* Subdominant IV (4-6-1) is away from home,
  sharing only one note with the I,
  but stable,
  being a major triad and having no leading tone.
  
The remaining chords sort into functions by similarity:
* Tonics vi (6-1-3) and iii (3-5-7) are close to home,
  sharing two notes with the I.
  (The iii does have the leading tone (7) however, 
  so in some cases it can act more as a dominant than a tonic.)
* Subdominant ii (2-4-6) is away from home,
  sharing no notes with I and one note with vi and iii;
  and it is close to the IV (sharing two notes with no dissonant intervals).
* Dominant vii (7-2-4) is tense, 
  containing a highly dissonant tritone interval between its root and diminished fifth
  (the 7&#x302; and 4&#x302; scale degrees).
  It has the leading tone as its root,
  pulling to the tonic.

### V-I cadence

A defining characteristic of most euroclassical and jazz music is the use of "cadences",
standard chord movements that end a musical phrase and establish a key center.

Cadences make use of the functions of the primary chords to establish their tension and resolution.
The basic cadence is called an "authentic cadence",
which moves from the V chord (the dominant) to the I chord (the tonic). 

This chord movement in a descending fifth (or ascending fourth) is a standard aspect of jazz and euroclassical idioms.

Listeners of these types of music have heard V-I cadences so often,
they have formed an expectation that the V will often lead to the I. 
This common expectation reinforces and enables the tricks of harmonic function. 
On the other hand,
listeners who have little experience of hearing music with V-I cadences will not have the same expectations,
and will not have the same response to harmonic functions.  

### Circle of fifths progressions

Jazz takes the cadential movement of descending fifths even further,
by putting a ii chord in front of the V-I cadence.

The ii is a perfect fifth above the V,
so the ii-V-I cadence gives the effect of repeatedly falling by perfect fifths until we reach the tonic.

In this context,
the ii is said to be "preparing" the V,
and it is referred to as having "pre-dominant" function.

The ii-V-I is the most common chord progression in jazz music.

Jazz arrangers typically don't stop there; 
they also pepare the pre-dominant chord with another chord a fifth above it,
and onward until the chord progressions are often based on a long series of descending fifths.
Often they will alter the intermediate chords in the progression by making them dominant sevenths,
to increase tension and propel the progression along to its final V-I cadence.

## More about intervals

### Finding intervals on the fretboard with the major scale

The easiest way to find any interval on the fretboard is to memorize the major scale on the fretboard.

Every degree of the major scale is a major or perfect interval from the tonic.
Degree 2&#x302; of the major scale is a major second from the tonic,
degree 5&#x302; is a perfect fifth,
degree 7&#x302; is a major seventh, and so on.

For example, to find a major third interval on the fretboard,
imagine the lower note is the tonic of a major scale,
and find the 3&#x302;.

To find a minor or diminished interval,
just lower the corresponding major or perfect interval by one fret.
For example,
to find a minor seventh,
find the major seventh (at degree 7&#x302;)
and the minor seventh is the fret below it.

See {% include chapter-link.html slug="major-scale" %} and {% include chapter-link.html slug="interval-scale" %}
for more information.

### Inverting intervals

"Ascending intervals" describe the distance from the *lower to the higher* pitch,
and are often described as going "up",
such as "up a (perfect) fourth".

"Descending intervals" describe the distance from the *higher to the lower* pitch,
and are often described as going "down",
such as "down a (perfect) fifth".

Discussion of intervals usually refers to the ascending interval,
unless explicitly stated otherwise. 

Somewhat counterintuitively,
because we hear two notes an octave apart as the same note,
the interval from the lower to the higher pitch is *different* than the interval from the higher to the lower pitch.
The descending interval is an "inversion" of the ascending interval. 

For example,
the interval between C and E is a major third.
But the interval from E to C is a *minor sixth*.
This is because the interval from C to E spans C-D-E,
but the interval from E to C spans E-F-G-A-B-C.

Similarly,
the interval from C to F is a perfect fourth,
and the interval from F to C is a perfect fifth.
A perfect fourth inverts to a perfect fifth. 
Therefore, moving "up a fourth" or "down a fifth" arrives at the same note (in a different octave).

A simple formula for inverting an interval is to 
(1) invert the quality of the original interval (major to/from minor, augmented to/from diminished, perfect stays perfect);
and (2) subtract the number of the original interval from 9.

Therefore, 
up a major third is the same as down a minor sixth,
up a perfect fifth is the same as down a perfect fourth,
up a minor seventh is the same as down a major second,
and so on.

### Consonance, dissonance, and frequency ratios

When two pitches sound together,
their sound waves overlap.
The more closely they overlap,
the more consonant and harmonically relaxed they sound.
The less they overlap,
the more dissonant and harmonically tense they sound. 

This overlap between sound waves can be measured by the ratio between the frequencies of the two pitches. 
The more closely they overlap,
the simpler the ratio. 

In a unison interval,
since the two pitches are the same,
their sound waves oscillate at the same frequency. 
The ratio between the frequencies is one-to-one (1:1).

In an octave,
one pitch vibrates twice as fast as the other.
The pitch frequency ratio of an octave is therefore 2:1.

The ratio of a perfect fifth is 3:2,
and a perfect fourth is 4:3.

Because these small-integer ratios are mathematically elegant,
and because they sound particularly consonant to our ears,
they are called perfect intervals.

Other intervals get mathematically more complex,
and therefore more dissonant.

The "tritone" interval, 
considered the most dissonant,
has a pitch frequency ratio of the square root of 2. 

These much more complex sound waves require more attention and processing from our brains,
which may account for their perceived dissonance. 

The frequency ratio of each interval is listed in the [interval table](#interval-table).
