## About shell voicings

Shell voicings are partial chord shapes which include only the essential notes required to evoke the sound of the desired chord.

In the case of the seventh chord shell voicings in this chapter,
the essential notes are the root,
third,
and seventh chord factors.

The perfect fifth can be left out of most chords without being missed.
One reason is that almost all chords contain a perfect fifth,
so having one doesn't distinguish one chord from another.

Another reason the perfect fifth can be omitted is that it's already resonating as the dominant overtone of the root's fundamental pitch.
This makes our brains hear a "phantom" fifth even when it's not actually being played.

The shell voicings given in this chapter are particularly useful.
They are easy to play,
they sound great together with naturally smooth voice leading,
and they are used as the basis for many extended and altered chords later on.

## Shell chord grips

Shell voicings are given for major seventh,
minor seventh,
and dominant chords,
which are enough to cover all the diatonic chords of Western harmony.
A min7 shell voicing can be played for a m7b5 chord,
since it omits the fifth.

Major seventh chords can sound a bit harsh at times,
especially as the I chord 
(which should typically feel like a place of rest).
Major sixth shell voicings can substitute for major 7 chords as a more relaxed alternative.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="color-chords" %} for more about substituting chords in this way.

## Shell chord progressions

### ii-V-I cadences

In jazz,
these shell voicings are commonly used for "comping" 
(playing chords in "accompaniment"),
commonly in the ii-V-I cadential progression.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="harmony-intro" %} 
for more information about ii-V-I cadences.

#### 6th string tonic

### Back cycling

Back cycling refers to a progression of dominant seventh chords in a sequence of descending fifths,
until they finally resolve to a tonic I,
like `III7-VI7-II7-V7-I`.

All the dominant chords except the V use notes from outside the key.
They are called "secondary dominants",
which "want" to resolve to the chord a fifth below according to euroclassical harmony.

This long chain of descending fifths creates increasing tension as it propels toward the final V-I cadence.

The shell voicings in this chapter are well suited to back cycling.

#### Basic dominant back cycling

{% include figure.html

    url="/assets/figures/shell-voicings/backcycling-I6.svg" 
    class="chord row"

#### Backcycling with tritone substitution

Jazz guitarists often use a device called "tritone substitution" to make the bass line more interesting.

After each secondary dominant,
another chord is inserted with all the same notes except for the root,
which is a tritone interval away.

Notice how smooth the voice leading is in this progression.
