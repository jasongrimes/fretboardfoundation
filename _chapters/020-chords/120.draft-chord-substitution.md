From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_substitution):

The diminished seventh chord is often used in place of a dominant 7th chord. In the key of A Major the V chord, E dominant 7th (which is made up the notes E, G♯, B, and D) can be replaced with a G♯ diminished seventh chord (G♯, B, D, F). If the diminished seventh chord (G♯) is followed by the I chord (A), this creates chromatic (stepwise semitonal) root movement, which can add musical interest in a song mainly constructed around the interval of the fourth or fifth. The diminished seventh chord on the sharpened second scale degree, ♯IIo7, may be used as a substitute dominant,[11] for example in C: ♯IIo7 = D♯–F♯–A–C♮ ↔ B–D♯–F♯–A = VII7.
