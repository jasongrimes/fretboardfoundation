## Emotion and story

Music is a form of communication.
It’s used to express ideas and emotions,
and to evoke the same in others.

Western harmony,
which derives from the European classical music (or “euroclassical”) tradition,
provides tools to do this,
based on consonance and dissonance,
tension and release,
and shared cultural experience. 

"Tension and release" is a basic biological mechanism,
shared perhaps by all life. 
It's the basis of locomotion---it physically moves us---and
it moves us emotionally as well.

Tension and release are created with consonant and dissonant sounds,
and by playing with listeners' expectations developed through all the music they have previously heard.

Harmonic functions can also be used to tell a kind of story,
similar in some ways to the _Hero's Journey_ narrative archetype:
the hero goes on an adventure, 
is victorious in a decisive crisis, 
and comes home transformed.

## Intervals: the building blocks

Intervals are the basic building blocks of scales, melodies, and chords.
They are responsible for the way music sounds and how it makes us feel. 

An interval describes the difference in pitch between two tones. 
A tone is a note with a discernible pitch,
and pitch is the frequency at which a sound wave vibrates.
The higher the frequency,
the faster the vibration,
and the higher the pitch sounds to our ears.
The larger an interval is between two tones,
the greater the difference in pitch between them.

Intervals have names like "major third",
with two parts: quality ("major") and number ("third").

The number or numeric size of an interval is the number of letter names from one note to the next in the musical alphabet.
For example, the interval from a C to a D is a second,
from C to E is a third,
and from C to G is a fifth.
The interval from C to the next C above or below is called an "octave" (meaning 8),
and from a note to itself is called a "unison" (meaning 1).

The quality of "fourth", "fifth", "octave", and "unison" intervals are called "perfect",
because their pitch frequency ratio is mathematically simple.
(The frequency ratio of a unison is 1:1---the pitches vibrate at the same rate.
The frequency ratio of an octave is 2:1---one pitch vibrates twice as fast as the other.
A perfect fifth is 3:2, and a perfect forth is 4:3.)
These integer ratio frequencies are more consonant to our ears. 
Other intervals get mathematically more complex,
and more "dissonant" to the ear.
The 6-semitone "tritone" interval (TT), 
which is widely heard as dissonant,
has a pitch frequency ratio of the square root of 2. 
This is a much more complex sound wave,
requiring more attention and processing
from our brains. 


The quality of the remaining intervals are either "major" or "minor",
which is determined by how many "semitones" they contain.

A "semitone" is the smallest interval in most Western music.
It's the difference between two notes on a guitar string on either side of one fret.
Semitones are also called "half steps".
A "tone" (or "whole tone" or "whole step") is two semitones,
a distance of two frets.

The following table shows the names of intervals based on how many semitones they span.

| semi-tones | interval | note from C  | short scale decree name | scale degree name |
|:------------|:-------:|:--------:| |:---------------------:|------------------:|
| 0   | unison | C       | 1     | tonic, one |
| 1   | minor second (m2)   | C# / Db | b2    | flat two |
| 2   | major second (M2)   | D     | 2     | two |
| 3   | minor third (m3)    | D# / Eb | #2 / b3    | sharp two / flat three |
| 4   | major third (M3)    | E     | 3     | three, major three |
| 5   | perfect fourth (P4) | F     | 4     | four |
| 6   | tritone, diminished fifth (TT), augmented fourth | F#/Gb | #4 / b5 | sharp four /flat five |
| 7   | perfect fifth (P5)  | G     | 5     | five |

- Intervals are the distance between notes
- Can express and evoke emotion
- Naming: Number and quality
- Major intervals are the same as the major scale degrees

## Chords

A chord is a group of two or more notes sounded together.

Chords are constructed by "stacking thirds" 
(in "tertian harmony" that is, 
the most common type in Western music.
There are others,
like "quartal harmony",
which is based on stacking fourths.)

Stacking thirds refers to adding successive intervals of a third until the chord has as many notes as we want it to.
Another way to think of stacking thirds is adding *every other* note in a scale. 

## Triad chords

A "triad chord" is a three-note chord built by stacking thirds.
Triads are the most common chords in Western music.

The components of a chord are sometimes called "factors".
The lowest factor in a chord is called the "root",
and the next factor is called the "third",
which is an interval of a major or minor third above the root.
The last factor in a triad is called the "fifth",
which either a perfect fifth (most commonly)
or else an augmented or diminished fifth above the root.
The interval from the third to the fifth is a major or minor third.

There are four types or "qualities" of triad,
based on the qualities of its intervals.

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| Triad quality  | Third interval        | Fifth interval (above third) above root |
| **major**      | M3                    | (m3) P5 |
| **minor**      | m3                    | (M3) P5 |
| **augmented**  | M3                    | (M3) #5 |
| **diminished** | m3                    | (m3) b5 |

## Tonical (aka tonal) harmony

- Music with a key center
- Euroclassical origin. 
- Common, but there are other kinds.
- Tonic vs leading tone. Tension and release. 

## Harmonizing a scale

- Building chords from scale degrees
- Roman numeral numbering

## Harmonic function

- The theoretical tendency of certain chords to "want" to progress to other chords, or remain at rest. 
- Euroclassical origin. Less used in modern and non-Western music, but still useful to understand.
- harmonic functions (tonic, subdominant/pre-dominant, dominant)
- V-I cadence and ii-V-I progression
- chord families 
  - tonic: I and vi (some also include iii, I disagree)
  - subdominant: IV and ii
  - dominant: V and vii (sometimes iii or III)
