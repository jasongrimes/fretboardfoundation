"Practice in all 12 keys" is a common recommendation in music instruction,
and it is probably a useful thing to do, eventually.
But thinking of the principle of triage,
it's better to spend two hours on something in C major 
than 10 minutes on it in each of 12 keys.

The time to add another key to our practice is when there's a real-world need to play in that key,
or we have become bored with every key we have already practiced.
Otherwise, it's best to continue working with an already-practiced key.
