## About CAGED

The CAGED system is a convenient way of thinking about movable chord shapes on guitar.
"Movable chords" are chord grips that can be played in any position up and down the neck,
because they don't have any open strings.
Every string is either stopped at a fret,
or muted by a convenient positioning of the hand.

When looked at in this way, 
a guitar in standard tuning has only five of these core movable shapes,
which in turn form the basis of every chord it is possible to play on guitar. 

The shapes are named after the familiar
C, A, G, E, and D chord shapes in "open position"
(that is, having open strings).

## On pain and ergonomics

Some of the CAGED chord shapes are awkward or even impossible to play in their entirety.
Gripping them incorrectly can lead to considerable pain over time,
especially in the case of barre chord grips for the A and E shapes.

Pain is a signal from our bodies that we are doing something wrong.
If we ignore the pain and don't change what we're doing,
the injury will get worse and take longer to heal. 
Eventually, our bodies will _force_ us to stop doing it.

It's far better to listen to our bodies from the beginning.
**If something hurts,
stop doing it right away**,
and figure out a painless way to do it
before the painful way has time to form into habit.

Aside from this general advice,
a few observations can be particularly helpful.

**Notice the elbow of the fretting arm.**

The reach and range of movement of the fretting fingers changes dramatically depending on the position of the elbow.
Move the elbow out to the side to allow fingers to reach down the neck more easily,
or move it in closer to the body to reach back up the neck.
Move the elbow out in front of the body to improve the fingers' reach of the low strings,
or pull it back to better reach the high strings.

Often, when we are struggling to place our fingers into a challenging chord grip,
the problem can be solved almost magically by simply adjusting the elbow until the position is more comfortable. 

**Keep the fretting wrist at a neutral angle.**

Among other benefits,
this prevents tendons from rubbing,
which can cause inflammation and injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome.

Keeping the wrist at a neutral angle can be made easier by adjusting the elbow,
as already described,
and by tilting the guitar neck upward. 
A strap with a suede backing can help hold the guitar tilted in a comfortable fretting position.

**Our hands are not crowbars**

While it is possible to use the thumb as a fulcrum to lever the fingers onto the fretboard with considerable pressure,
our hands are full of joints that need to be held rigidly in place in order to treat the arm as a crowbar.
Joints are designed to move,
not to hold rigid,
especially against forces applied in the joint's weakest direction.
This technique may seem to be powerful at first,
but over time is likely to lead to injury, 
and possibly basal joint arthritis.

Instead,
the thumb should be pressed lightly against the neck,
_if at all_.
The fretting thumb's main use should be to keep the hand gently in contact with the neck,
so it stays in one place instead of floating around in space when the fingers are off the fretboard.

It's possible to fret a guitar without using the thumb at all,
and it's a good idea to do so sometimes,
to experiment with how little thumb pressure is actually needed.

Sometimes the pressure from the fingers is enough to bend the neck back slightly,
causing the notes to bend sharp,
and releasing enough pressure to solve it causes the strings to buzz against the frets.

In that case, the thumb should gently pinch the back of the neck directly behind the fingers,
pressing just hard enough that the notes don't go sharp.
Pinching too hard can cause the notes to bend sharp between the fret and the board,
not pinching hard enough can cause them to bend sharp from finger pressure on the neck,
or to buzz against the frets from lack of pressure.

We need to adjust the pressure from the fingers and thumb until the notes are pitched true,
and the joints are under minimal strain.

This is the point at which intonation and ergonomics are in harmony---the perfect grip,
the purest tone with the least effort.

## Mind the intervals

When learning and practicing these shapes,
it's important to be mindful of what role each note plays in the chord,
rather than mindlessly playing shapes.
We should always be aware of which note is the root, 
third (or minor third), fifth, etc.

This is important for two reasons. 
First, it allows us to make any chord we need just by adjusting a known chord shape.
(For example, lower the third of a major chord by one fret and it becomes a minor chord.)
Second, it leads to almost accidentally learning the most important interval shapes _and sounds_ all over the fretboard,
which is extremely useful for improvising and playing by ear.

It's especially important to know the root note in each chord shape,
since that's how we know where to place the chord.

## Notation

The dots in the chord diagrams that follow are labeled with the interval of each chord tone from the root.
`R` is the root note, 
`3` is the major third, 
`b3` is the minor third, etc.

Guitar strings are numbered from 1-6,
with 1 being the highest pitched string and 6 the lowest.

Fingerings are notated with six-digit symbols,
representing the six strings of the guitar 6-1 from left-to-right,
with each string having the number of the finger used to fret it,
or an "x" indicating the string is muted.

For example: `x4312x`

Finger 1 is the index finger, 
2 is the middle finger,
3 is the ring finger,
and 4 is the little finger.

The fingering symbols are intuitive if we imagine them placed at the bottom of the chord diagrams,
lined up with the strings.

## C shapes

### C major shape

The basic C major shape is a straightforward triad chord.
The root note is the lowest note of the chord
(meaning the chord is in "root position"),
the third and fifth are stacked directly on top of the root with no gaps
(which is called a "closed voicing"),
and then the root note is repeated again at the octave,
so the root is both the highest and lowest note.

Play the chord tones in sequence `R-3-5-R`,
and notice how it sounds just like walking up the stairs,
all steps and no leaps.
That's the sound of a closed voicing.
This kind of closed voice root position triad sounds strong and clear.

The basic chord grip for this shape is `x4312x`.
It is a surprisingly comfortable and convenient grip,
once it becomes familiar.
The 1st string can be comfortably muted with the side of the fretting hand,
and the 6th string can be muted by either the tip of the little finger or with the thumb.

The bass note for this chord is played with the little finger on the 5th string.
It's common to reach the little finger over to the 6th string,
to play an alternating bass line between the root on the 5th string and the perfect fifth on the 6th string. 

Sometimes it sounds good to add the major third on the highest string,
which can be done by flattening the first finger: `x43121`

Another variation is to play just the "treble triad" on the top three (treble) strings `xxx121`,
optionally adding the bass note with the little finger: `x4x121`.

To get a feel for this chord shape,
first play it in open position,
with the little finger on the 3rd fret of the 5th string 
(the note C, making it a C chord).
Then move it up the neck so the root is on the 8th fret of the 5th string (F, making it an F chord).
Then move the root up to the 10th fret of the 5th string (G).
Play around with these three "primary" chords for awhile.
