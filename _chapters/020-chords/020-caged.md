abstract: Movable chord grips for CAGED shapes that are actually useful.
---

The CAGED system is a convenient way of thinking about movable chord shapes on guitar.
_Movable chords_ are chord grips that can be played in any position up and down the neck,
because they don't have any open strings.

On a guitar in standard tuning,
there are only five of these core movable chord shapes,
which in turn form the basis of every chord it is possible to make on guitar. 


## C shape

The C CAGED shape has roots on the second and fifth strings.
