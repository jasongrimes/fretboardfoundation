## About CAGED

The CAGED system is a convenient way of thinking about movable chord shapes on guitar.
"Movable chords" are chord grips that can be played in any position up and down the neck,
because they don't have any open strings.
Every string is either stopped at a fret,
or muted by a convenient positioning of the hand.

On a guitar in standard tuning,
there are only five of these core movable chord shapes,
which in turn form the basis of every chord it is possible to play on guitar. 
The shapes are named after the familiar
C, A, G, E, and D chord shapes in _open position_ 
(that is, having open strings).

## Mind the chord intervals

When learning and practicing these shapes,
it's important to be mindful of what role each note plays in the chord,
rather than mindlessly playing shapes.
We should always be aware of which note is the root, 
third (or minor third), fifth, etc.

This is important for two reasons. 
First, it allows us to make any chord we need just by adjusting a known chord shape.
(For example, lower the third of a major chord by one fret and it becomes a minor chord.)
Second, it leads to almost accidentally learning the most important interval shapes _and sounds_ all over the fretboard,
which is extremely useful for improvising and playing by ear.

It's especially important to know the root note in each chord shape,
since that's how we know where to place the chord.

## Notation for fingerings and intervals

The dots in the chord diagrams below are labeled with the interval of each chord tone from the root.
`R` is the root note, 
`3` is the major third, 
`b3` is the minor third, etc.

Guitar strings are numbered from 1-6,
with 1 being the highest pitched string and 6 the lowest.

Fingerings are notated with six-digit symbols,
representing the six strings of the guitar 6-1 from left-to-right,
with each string having the number of the finger used to fret it,
or an "x" indicating the string is muted.

For example: `x4312x`

Finger 1 is the index finger, 
2 is the middle finger,
3 is the ring finger,
and 4 is the little finger.

## C shapes

### C major shape

The basic C major shape is a straightforward triad chord.
The root note is the lowest note in the chord
(meaning the chord is in "root position"),
the third and fifth are stacked directly on top of the root with no gaps
(which is called a "closed voicing"),
and then the root note is repeated again at the octave,
so the root is both the highest and lowest note.
This kind of closed voice root position triad sounds strong and clear.

The basic chord grip for this shape is `x4312x`.
It is a surprisingly comfortable and convenient grip,
once it becomes familiar.
The 1st string can be comfortably muted with the side of the fretting hand,
and the 6th string can be muted by either the tip of the little finger or with the thumb.

The bass note for this chord is played with the little finger on the 5th string.
It's common to reach the little finger over to the 6th string,
to play an alternating bass line between the root on the 5th string and the perfect fifth on the 6th string. 

Sometimes it sounds good to add the major third on the highest string,
which can be done by flattening the first finger: `x43121`

Another variation is to play just the "treble triad" on the top three (treble) strings `xxx121`,
optionally adding the bass note with the little finger: `x4x121`.

To get a feel for this chord shape,
first play it in open position,
with the little finger on the 3rd fret of the 5th string 
(the note C, making it a C chord).
Then move it up the neck so the root is on the 5th string 8th fret (F, making it an F chord).
Then move the root up to 5th string 10th fret (G).
Play around with these three "primary" chords for awhile.
