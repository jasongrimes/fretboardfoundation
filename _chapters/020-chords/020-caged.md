## About CAGED

The CAGED system is a convenient way of thinking about movable chord shapes on guitar.
"Movable chords" are chord grips that can be played in any position up and down the neck,
because they don't have any open strings.
Every string is either stopped at a fret,
or muted by a convenient positioning of the hand.

When looked at in this way, 
a guitar in standard tuning has only five of these core movable shapes,
which in turn form the basis of every chord it is possible to play on guitar. 

The shapes are named after the familiar
C, A, G, E, and D chord shapes in "open position"
(that is, having open strings).

## Ergonomics: pain and intonation

Some of the CAGED chord shapes are awkward or even impossible to play in their entirety.
Gripping them incorrectly can lead to significant pain over time,
notably in the case of barre chord grips for the A and E shapes.

Pain is a signal from our bodies that we are doing something wrong.
If we ignore the pain and don't change what we're doing,
the injury will get worse and take longer to heal. 
Eventually, our bodies will _force_ us to stop doing it.

It's far better to listen to our bodies from the beginning.
**If something hurts,
stop doing it right away**,
and figure out a painless way to do it
before the painful way has time to form into habit.

Aside from this general advice,
a few observations can be particularly helpful.

**Notice the elbow of the fretting arm.**

The reach and range of movement of the fretting fingers changes dramatically depending on the position of the elbow.
Move the elbow out to the side to allow fingers to reach down the neck more easily,
or move it in closer to the body to reach back up the neck.
Move the elbow out in front of the body to improve the fingers' reach of the low strings,
or pull it back to better reach the high strings.

Often, when we are struggling to place our fingers into a challenging chord grip,
the problem can be solved almost magically by simply adjusting the elbow until the position is more comfortable. 

**Keep the fretting wrist at a neutral angle.**

Among other benefits,
this prevents tendons from rubbing,
which can cause inflammation and injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome.

Keeping the wrist at a neutral angle can be made easier by adjusting the elbow,
as already described,
and by tilting the guitar neck upward. 
A strap with a suede backing can help hold the guitar tilted in a comfortable fretting position.

**Our hands are not crowbars**

While it is possible to use the thumb as a fulcrum to lever the fingers onto the fretboard with considerable pressure,
our hands are full of joints that need to be held rigidly in place in order to do so.
Joints are designed to move,
not to hold rigid,
especially against forces applied in the joint's weakest direction.
This technique may seem powerful at first,
but over time it is likely to lead to injury,
possibly including basal joint arthritis.

Instead,
the thumb should be pressed lightly against the neck,
_if at all_.
The fretting thumb's main use should be to keep the hand gently in contact with the neck,
so it stays in one place instead of floating around in space when the fingers are off the fretboard.

It's possible to fret a guitar without using the thumb at all,
and it's a good practice to do so sometimes,
to give the thumb a rest and to experiment with how little pressure is actually needed.

Sometimes the pressure from the fingers is enough to bend the neck back slightly,
causing the notes to bend sharp,
and releasing enough pressure to solve it causes the strings to buzz against the frets.

In that case, the thumb should gently pinch the back of the neck directly behind the fingers,
pressing just hard enough that the notes don't go sharp.
Pinching too hard can cause the notes to bend sharp between the fret and the board,
while not pinching hard enough can cause them to bend sharp from finger pressure on the neck,
or to buzz against the frets from lack of pressure.

We need to adjust the pressure from the fingers and thumb until the notes are pitched true,
and the joints are under minimal strain.

This is the point at which intonation and ergonomics are in harmony---the perfect grip,
the purest tone with the least effort.

*Mastering Guitar Technique: Process and Essence* 
[(Berg, 1997)](references#berg-1997) 
has a great deal more about optimal positioning of the body for playing guitar.


## Mind the intervals

When learning and practicing these shapes,
it's important to be mindful of the role each note serves in the chord,
rather than thoughtlessly playing occult chord shapes.
We should always be aware of which note is the root, 
third (or minor third), fifth, etc.

This is important for two reasons. 
First, it allows us to make any chord we need just by adjusting a known chord shape.
(For example, lower the third of a major chord by one fret and it becomes a minor chord.)

Second, it leads to almost accidentally learning the most important interval shapes and sounds all over the fretboard,
which is extremely useful for improvising and playing by ear.

It's especially important to know the root notes in each chord shape,
since that's how we know where to place the chord.


## Notation

The dots in the chord diagrams that follow are labeled with the simple interval of each chord tone from the root.
`R` is the root note, 
`3` is the major third, 
`b3` is the minor third, etc.

Guitar strings are numbered from 1-6,
with 1 being the highest pitched string and 6 the lowest.

Chord fingerings are notated like this: `x4312x`.
The six symbols represent the six strings of the guitar from lowest pitch to highest, 
6-1 from left to right,
and indicate the number of the finger used to fret each string,
or an "x" indicating the string is muted.

Finger 1 is the index finger, 
2 is the middle finger,
3 is the ring finger,
and 4 is the little finger.

The fingering symbols are intuitive if we imagine them placed at the bottom of the chord diagrams,
lined up with the strings.

## C shapes

### C major shape

{% include figure.html
    caption="C major shape."
    url="/assets/figures/caged2/C-maj.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

The basic C major shape is a straightforward triad chord.
The chord tones are in the order `R-3-5`,
(which is called "root position"),
the third and fifth are stacked directly on top of the root with no gaps
(which is called a "closed voicing"),
and then the root note is repeated again at the octave,
so the root is both the highest and lowest note.

Play the chord tones in sequence `R-3-5-R`,
and notice how it sounds just like walking up the stairs,
with all the tones packed together into a single octave.
That's the sound of a closed voicing.
This kind of closed-voice root-position triad sounds strong and clear.

The basic chord grip for this shape is `x4312x`.
It's a surprisingly comfortable and convenient grip,
once it becomes familiar.
The 1st string can be comfortably muted with the side of the fretting hand,
and the 6th string can be muted by either the tip of the little finger or with the thumb.

The bass note for this chord is played with the little finger on the 5th string.
It's common to reach the little finger over to the 6th string,
to play an alternating bass line between the root on the 5th string and the perfect fifth on the 6th string. 

Sometimes it sounds good to add the major third on the highest string,
which can be done by flattening the first finger: `x43121`

Another variation is to play just the "treble triad" on the top three (treble) strings `xxx121`,
with the root on the 2nd string,
optionally adding the bass note with the little finger: `x4x121`.

To get a feel for this chord shape,
first play it in open position,
with the little finger on the 3rd fret of the 5th string 
(the note C, making it a C chord).
Then move it up the neck so the root is on the 8th fret of the 5th string (F, making it an F chord).
Then move the root up to the 10th fret of the 5th string (G).
Finish by moving the root up to the 15th fret on the 5th string 
(aka the 3rd fret above the octave),
another C chord.

Play around with these three "primary" chords for awhile to get familiar with the shape at different parts of the neck.

**Practice C shape with primary chords in the key of C major:**

| 5th string root on fret | Note | Shape  | Chord |
|:-----------------------:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|
| 3                       | C    | major  | C     |
| 8                       | F    | major  | F     |
| 10                      | G    | major  | G     |
| 15<br>(3+12)            | C    | major  | C     |

### C minor shape

{% include figure.html
    caption="C minor shape."
    url="/assets/figures/caged2/C-min.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

The C minor shape is just the C major shape with the third lowered by one fret.
But what a difference that small change makes for playability.

The C minor shape can seem impractical,
unsuited to human hands.
But when we realize that we can leave out some of the notes,
it becomes more useful.

One common grip for this shape is `x421xx`,
a minimalist, three-note closed-voice triad.
The first finger mutes the top two strings.

Sometimes it's nice to have the root note repeated on top of the chord as the highest pitch.
In that case,
pull the first finger down to the 2nd string,
using the tip of it to mute the 3rd string:
`x42x1x`.

In this grip, we're no longer playing the fifth of the chord.
But having the bass in the root, 
the minor third (making it a minor chord),
and then repeating the root at the top,
we often don't notice the missing fifth.

Another variation is to play the treble triad on the upper-middle three strings,
with the root on the second string: `xx213x`.

Try playing the chord tones in order,
`R-b3-5-R`,
starting with the fingers in `x421xx`,
and then rotating into `xx213x`.

To get comfortable with the C minor shape in different places on the neck,
use it to play the primary chords in the key of C minor.

**Practice C shapes with primary chords in the key of C minor:**

| 5th string root on fret | Note | Shape  | Chord |
|:-----------------------:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|
| 3                       | C    | minor  | Cm    |
| 8                       | F    | minor  | Fm    |
| 10                      | G    | minor  | Gm    |
| 10                      | G    | major  | G     |
| 15<br>(3+12)            | C    | minor  | Cm    |

When both the C major and C minor shapes are familiar,
practice them together by playing all the triads in the key of C major,
as shown.

**Practice C shapes with harmonized triads in the key of C major:**

| 5th string root on fret | Note | Shape  | Chord |
|:-----------------------:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|
| 3                       | C    | major  | C     |
| 5                       | D    | minor  | Dm    |
| 7                       | E    | minor  | Em    |
| 8                       | F    | major  | F     |
| 10                      | G    | major  | G     |
| 12                      | A    | minor  | Am    |
| 14<br>(2+12)            | B    | minor (no 5)<br>`x42x1x` | Bm (no 5)   |
| 15<br>(3+12)            | C    | major  | C     |

### C diminished shape

{% include figure.html
    caption="C diminished shape."
    url="/assets/figures/caged2/C-dim.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

All the triad chords in a major key are either major or minor chords,
except one:
the vii chord is a diminished triad.
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="major-harmony" %} for details.

In the key of C,
the vii chord is actually Bdim, 
a B diminished triad.
We got away with playing Bm(no 5) earlier,
because Bdim and Bm are the same chord except for the fifth.

One common grip for this shape is `x421xx`,
and another is to play the root at the top with the treble triad `xx213x`.
Sometimes it's also useful to grip it with `xx2134` or even `xx1x23`.

To practice this shape,
play the same harmonized chords as when practicing the C minor shape,
except play Bdim instead of Bm(no 5).

## A shapes

### A major shape

{% include figure.html
    caption="A major shape."
    url="/assets/figures/caged2/A-maj.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

The A major shape is one of the first barre chords learned by beginner guitarists.

Unlike the C major shape,
the A major shape is an "open voicing".
The third is an octave above the root.
Play the chord tones in order to hear the difference:
`R-3-5-R` (strings `5-2-4-3`).

The main triad in this chord shape is the mini-barre on strings `4-3-2`,
in which the chord tones are ordered `5-R-3`.
This ordering is called the "second inversion" of the chord,
which sounds noticeably different than the root position voicing.

The bass note for this chord is played with the first finger on the 5th string. 
As with the C shape,
it’s common to reach the first finger over to the 6th string,
to play the perfect fifth in an alternating bass line.

Played as a barre chord,
the fingering for this shape is `x13331`,
or `x13341`.
As when playing any barre chord,
never try to clamp down the first finger across the whole fretboard like a vice,
which will lead to pain.
Instead,
the first finger should be slightly curved,
pressing down only at the tip 
(on the 5th string)
and the side of the base of the finger
(on the first string).

More comfortably,
we often don't need the extra fifth on the top string,
so we can just play it like this:
`x1333x` or `x1444x` or `x1334x`,
muting the 1st string with the side of the third (or fourth) finger.

We can also just play the treble triads by themselves:
`xx333x` and `xxx341`.

To get familiar with this shape up and down the neck,
use it to play the primary chords in the key of C major.

**Practice A shape with primary chords in the key of C major:**

| 5th string root on fret | Note | Shape  | Chord |
|:-----------------------:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|
| 3                       | C    | major  | C     |
| 8                       | F    | major  | F     |
| 10                      | G    | major  | G     |

### A minor shape

{% include figure.html
    caption="A minor shape."
    url="/assets/figures/caged2/A-min.svg"
    class="chord row"
%}

The A minor shape is another common barre chord learned by beginners.
Played as a barre, the fingering is `x13421`.

There are other grips that can be more comfortable than the barre chord. 

An interesting grip for this shape is `x1x432`.
This voicing focuses on the treble triad on the top-3 strings,
which is a root-position closed-voice triad.
It then adds the root note in the bass.

The treble triads can also be played by themselves: 
`xxx321` and `xx231x`.

| 5th string root on fret | Note | Shape  | Chord |
