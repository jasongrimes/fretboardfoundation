## Guitar has a built-in bass

The guitar is one of the few instruments that that can cover both the bass and treble registers.

When playing along with a bass or piano player,
we actually need to be careful not to play over them in the lower frequencies,
which can cause the bass to sound blurred or muddy.
In those cases we
can leave out the notes on low strings and play "inside" and "treble" voicings.

But in the absence of a bass player,
we can provide the bass line ourselves.

## Root note on down beats 

Start by playing the root note of the chord on the down beat,
before or even instead of the rest of the chord.

Begin listening to the bass notes as their own line that leads and complements the chords.

## Add fifths, octaves, and approach tones 

Then make the bass line more interesting by adding in the fifth. 

Smooth out the bass line by adding approach notes before the root and fifth---either 
a chromatic tone, scale tone, or chord tone immediately above or below the target note.

The book *Building Walking Bass Lines*, 
by Ed Friedland [(1995)](references.html#friedland-1995),
has more information about composing good bass lines.
