The guitar is one of the few instruments that that can cover both the bass and treble registers.

When playing along with a bass or piano player,
we can leave out the notes on low strings and play "inside" and "treble" voicings.
But in the absence of a bass player,
we can provide the bass line ourselves.


Start by playing a bass note on down beats,
in its own line that leads and complements the chords.

Start by just playing the root note in the bass.

Then make the bass line more interesting by adding in the fifth. 

Smooth out the bass line by adding approach notes before the root and fifth---either 
a chromatic tone, scale tone, or chord tone immediately above or below the target note.

The book *Building Walking Bass Lines*, 
by Ed Friedland [(1995)](references.html#friedland-1995),
has more information about composing good bass lines.
