## 1st-string root, 6th-string bass

First-string root triads have bass root notes on the sixth and fourth strings.
For the major triad,
I almost always play it on the upper middle strings as on the first diagram,
and only play the first string root note as needed.

## 2nd-string root, 4th/5th-string bass

Second-string root triads have bass root notes on the fourth string (above)
and the fifth string (below).

and sixth and first strings (below).

## Bass lines

-->

Start by playing a bass note on down beats,
in its own line that leads and complements the chords.

Start by just playing the root note in the bass.

Then make the bass line more interesting by adding in the fifth. 

Smooth out the bass line by adding approach notes before the root and fifth---either 
a chromatic tone, scale tone, or chord tone immediately above or below the target note.

The book *Building Walking Bass Lines*, 
by Ed Friedland [(1995)](references.html#friedland-1995),
has more information about composing good bass lines.
