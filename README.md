# Fretboard Foundation

This is the source code for a book Iâ€™m slowly writing called
_Fretboard Foundation: Practical building blocks for intermediate guitarists_, hosted at [fretboardfoundation.com](https://fretboardfoundation.com).

The website is rendered into static HTML with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), 
using a custom Jekyll theme I wrote called 
[jekyll-chapterbook](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook).

## Style guide

See [Journal of Music Theory Style Guide](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Assets/Downloads/JMT_sg.pdf)

### Internal links

When linking to internal chapter pages,
use the `slug` specified in the chapter frontmatter.
This ensures that the links will continue to work if the files are renamed.

Ex.:

```markdown
See the [introduction page](introduction) for more information.

See [this diagram](appendix-diagrams#foo).
```

### Adding references
 
* [APA style](https://www.scribbr.com/citing-sources/citation-styles/#apa)
* [APA citation generator](https://www.scribbr.com/apa-citation-generator/)

In-text example: 

```
[(Vincent, 2011)](references#vincent-2011)
```

[(Vincent, 2011)](references#vincent-2011)

Reference list:

Use the `references-chapter` layout in the references chapter so that the citations are formatted with hanging indents.

Include a link in the citation (like the ISBN search below), 
and assign it an `id` attribute with `{:#my-id}` so the anchor links from in-text citations work.
