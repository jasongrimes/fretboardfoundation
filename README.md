### Internal links

When linking to internal chapter pages,
use the `slug` specified in the chapter frontmatter.
This ensures that the links will continue to work if the files are renamed.

Ex.:

```markdown
See the [introduction page](introduction) for more information.

See [this diagram](appendix-diagrams#foo).
```

### Adding references
 
* [APA style](https://www.scribbr.com/citing-sources/citation-styles/#apa)
* [APA citation generator](https://www.scribbr.com/apa-citation-generator/)

In-text example: 

```
[(Vincent, 2011)](references#vincent-2011)
```

[(Vincent, 2011)](references#vincent-2011)

Reference list:

Use the `references-chapter` layout in the references chapter so that the citations are formatted with hanging indents.

Include a link in the citation (like the ISBN search below), 
and assign it an `id` attribute with `{:#my-id}` so the anchor links from in-text citations work.

```
Vincent, R. (2011). *Three-Note Voicings and Beyond.* Sher Music Co.
[ISBN search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources?isbn=1-883217-66-0){:#vincent-2011}
```

### Jekyll Themes
