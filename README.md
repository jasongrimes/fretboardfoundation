# Fretboard Foundation

This is the source code for a book Iâ€™m slowly writing called
_Fretboard Foundation: Practical building blocks for intermediate guitarists_, hosted at [fretboardfoundation.com](https://fretboardfoundation.com).

The website is rendered into static HTML with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), 
using a custom Jekyll theme I wrote called 
[jekyll-chapterbook](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook).
